# Online Purchase Transparency

## Description
Online Grocery Shopping can increase transparency in food products by allowing customers to see nutritional, sourcing, etc online before making a purchase. Do not have the pressure of making this decision in a supermarket with limited time or information. - Shopping online enables the algorithm to predict more healthy options for you based on your last consumption (given that it was a healthy food to start with)
