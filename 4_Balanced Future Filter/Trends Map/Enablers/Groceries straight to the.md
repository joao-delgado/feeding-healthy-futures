# Groceries straight to the office

## Description
Workplace: Workers will be able to order their groceries straight to the office so they can take them home after their shift, saving them time from going to the supermarket or picking them up at the store. Last minute items for a family dinner can be sent straight to the office or home if in proximity to drop-off location.
