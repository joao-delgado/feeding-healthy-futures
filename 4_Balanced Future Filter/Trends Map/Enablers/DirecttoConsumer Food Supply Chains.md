# Direct-to-Consumer Food Supply Chains

## Description
The traditional food retail model will face significant disruption by 2030 as producers increasingly establish direct relationships with consumers. This shift builds on broader direct-to-consumer trends already transforming retail markets3. Advanced logistics systems, subscription models, and digital platforms will enable farmers and specialty producers to bypass traditional distribution channels, delivering fresher products while capturing higher margins. Consumers will value the perceived authenticity, transparency, and quality assurance of these direct relationships, particularly for premium and specialty food products where provenance and production methods significantly impact perceived value.
