# Reduction in Antimicrobial Use in Food Production

## Description
The global concern over antimicrobial resistance is driving significant changes in food production systems. By 2030, we can expect stricter regulations and consumer demand to substantially reduce antimicrobial usage in food-producing animals. This trend responds to mounting evidence that widespread use of veterinary antimicrobials drives resistance with important consequences for both animal and human health. Current projections suggest global antimicrobial usage will reach approximately 104,079 tonnes by 2030, reflecting an 11.5% increase from 2017 levels despite growing awareness of their negative impacts8. This relatively modest increase (compared to earlier projections) indicates that antimicrobial stewardship efforts are gaining traction, particularly in major markets like China, though continued vigilance remains essential as animal protein demand continues to rise globally1.
