# Hyper flexibility could change cultures and socialization

## Description
The rise of non-specific meal times - flexibility to when one feels like it or in a social situation for it (allows for more bodily discernment) affects local culture (for an e.g tea time or coffee time in Italy and Portugal are big part of socialisation and a sense of understanding the culture which erodes when people do things more individualistically!)
