# Modern day migration

## Description
Due to climate change, wars or even the possibility of digital nomad-ism, there is a big increase of people leaving their home countries in search of new places. Whilst this can be good, this also poses stress on the infrastructure of a place and the current import of food to meet the needs of this immigration.
