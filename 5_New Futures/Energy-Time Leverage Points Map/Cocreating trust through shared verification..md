# Co-creating trust through shared verification.

## Description
-  Promote the idea of “food citizenship,” where consumers, producers, and regulators jointly own the truth behind a label. Frame labels not as guarantees but as starting points for community verification (e.g., scanning codes to see farmer stories).   -  Sponsor “label hackathons” where consumer groups decode and annotate labels together to turn confusion into collective knowledge   Expected Impact: Feed more connected with the brand, and less desilusional and desinpowered by barrage of information   #trust
