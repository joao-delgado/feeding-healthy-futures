## Description
: Develop supply chains that prioritize local sourcing for staple healthy foods while using global networks only for specialty items, reducing uncertainty while maintaining variety.   Partner with smaller distribution warehouses in targeted markets for more seasonal or localized products.      Expected Effect:   Decentralized locations for purchasing superior quality of product. Consumers can taste and sense the quality, leading to higher desire for product.   #transition-areas
