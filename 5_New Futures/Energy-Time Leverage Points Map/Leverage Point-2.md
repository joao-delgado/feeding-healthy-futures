# Leverage Point

## Description
: Contextual Nudge Orchestration Integrate AI across all touchpoints (kitchen, shopping apps, social media, voice assistants) to create seamless, context-aware nudges toward healthier choices that feel natural and helpful rather than manipulative, adapting to the user's decision-making patterns.   Expected Effect:   Consumers have very habitual patterns with very fast paced lives, creating nudges for making a better choice, even just drinking water, or being reminded to get fruit at the store, is a helpful needed reminder to encourage healthy habits.     #hyper-personalization #leverage-point
