# Leverage Point

## Description
Deceptive Marketing Alert Systems:: Develop consumer resource (non-profit organization) that automatically flag misleading health claims and suggest genuinely healthier alternatives, protecting consumers from confusing marketing.    Expected Effect:   Help consumers navigate suggestive health benefits that carry no legitimacy.   Examples: Establish an independent “Label Ombudsman” that mediates disputes and holds up suspicious claims before they flood the market. "Natural" - As you mentioned, this is completely unregulated by the FDA and essentially meaningless. "Low-Fat" or "Fat-Free" - These products typically compensate by adding extra sugar, sodium, or artificial ingredients. "Good Source of..." or "Contains..." - These often highlight one beneficial nutrient while ignoring that the product is otherwise nutritionally poor.   #trust #leverage-point
