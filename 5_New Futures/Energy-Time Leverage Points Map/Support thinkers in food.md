# Support thinkers in food to reframe globalization through “Global Flavors, Local Wisdom”  Support leaders in the food industry to reposition globalization from being seen as a force of dilution or loss to one of creative renewal  where traditional food knowledge (e.g. spice blends, fermentation, plant-based dishes) meets modern nutritional and environmental goals.  This honors heritage, empowers local voices, and generates new demand for healthy, rooted cuisines.
