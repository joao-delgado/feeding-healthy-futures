# Educational Institution Cooking Education and Discounted Healthy Food Options Partnership Opportunities

## Description
Young adulthood (18-25) often shows the opposite trend: Moving away from home, starting work or study, and the changing lifestyle that accompanies the late teens and early 20s can cause dietary changes that are not always beneficial for good health.  Partner with Universities to create cooking instructional courses for college students and use them to unload extra inventory (slow moving products) at a discounted rate.  Create  a cooking challenge for the students with prizes.    Expected Effect:   Early brand adoption and building the foundational knowledge for future healthy food options through cooking instruction for young adults transiting into adulthood. .    #educational-and-food-pedagogy
