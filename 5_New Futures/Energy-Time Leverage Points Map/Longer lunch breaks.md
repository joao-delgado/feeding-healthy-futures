# LONGER LUNCH BREAKS

## Description
Workplaces might create “slow lunch clubs” where colleagues share nutritious meals once a week. Schools can ban sale of sugary snacks, replacing them with interactive snack stands that offer tasting of local fruits.   Expected effects: People have more incentive to go to the work place, and it becomes a third space for healthy eating and even ordering food.  health is also seen more holistically.  Expected effects: People have more time to eat more satiating meals that allow for less reliance on hpf.   #work
