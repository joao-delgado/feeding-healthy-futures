# Hybrid Shopping Models

## Description
Develop services that combine online convenience with periodic in-person "sensory sampling" sessions for key healthy products. An online grocery can identify their key markets and then create a in-person tasting in an area with a heavy concentration of their consumers for a tasting of products. Or partner with an event to have a booth/stand.: Expected Effect: Bridge the gap for consumers who make online purchases by creating an opportunity to have an awareness ofÂ  the selection of fresh products   #trust
