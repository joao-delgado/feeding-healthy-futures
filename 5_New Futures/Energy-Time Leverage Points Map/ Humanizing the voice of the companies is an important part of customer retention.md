# Humanizing the voice of the companies is an important part of customer retention

## Description
- Help consumers to see the companies as human)* The Ordinary Co as inspiration for the food industry*  Using radical transparency as a way to get consumers to understand what is happening with companies*   - New technology like blockchain, qr codes, or even micro-sites are a good way to trace and have visibility of transparency. The important part about transparency is in building trust and that is in explaining the difficult parts of the sourcing transparency.  Make food loss and externalities of commodity chains transparent to consumers and investors (e.g., “true cost” grocery labeling; embedded carbon, labor, and waste costs).   Expected impact: Make consumers understand the side of companies and relate with their visions   #trust
