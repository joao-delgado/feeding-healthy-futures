# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
**Participating in food challenges**

Cooking is an Experiment
Failure can be a part of Cooking and it is okay

### How:

Recipes designed with built-in error tolerance and multiple acceptable outcomes, removing the intimidation factor that prevents people from attempting home cooking.
