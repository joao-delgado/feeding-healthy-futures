[[Food education as an agent of change]]

# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
**Be a Role Model and Teacher for your Family Members, Friends and Peers**



### How:
For individuals who have established healthy eating habits already, teach others your ideas, recipes, tips and tricks, and inspire. Share reminders through messages, calls or even schedule online dinner time recipes with those further away and you know may be lonely
