[[Food education as an agent of change]]

# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
**Meal planning and preparation**
Knowledge of Planning and Preparation Techniques 


### How:
Educational programs foster meal planning, grocery list creation, and batch cooking habits. When people understand nutrition principles, they're more likely to dedicate time to food preparation rather than relying on convenience foods. This includes learning to prep ingredients in advance, understanding food storage, and developing cooking skills that make healthy options more accessible and appealing.
