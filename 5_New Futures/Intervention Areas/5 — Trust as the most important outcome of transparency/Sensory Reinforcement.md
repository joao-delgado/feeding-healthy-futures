[[Trust as the most important outcome of transparency]]

# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
Sensory Reinforcement
Create more opportunities for  "sensory sampling" in a world of packaging and online shopping 


### How:
Bridge the gap for consumers who make online purchases by creating an opportunity to have an awareness of  the selection of fresh products. Businesses can partner with supermarkets, public markets, event spaces, festival, etc to create more opportunity for sensory experience with foods often prepackaged
