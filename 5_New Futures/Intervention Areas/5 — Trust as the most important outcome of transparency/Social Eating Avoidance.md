# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
Social Eating Avoidance
Skipping social meals to maintain dietary goals without judgment.


### How:
Trusting in yourself as a tactic for transparency about your food choices. Taking time to eat in a conscious slowed down way that allows you to
