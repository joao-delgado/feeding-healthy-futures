[[Trust as the most important outcome of transparency]]

# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
Trusted Status Signaling
Create pathways for individuals to gain social recognition as neighborhood nutrition resources, making healthy food knowledge a source of social capital.


### How:

Use members of the community, who have developed trust to help communicate healthier habits.  Research shows that the trustworthiness of a source is a stronger predictor of whether someone will follow dietary advice than simply how often they seek out information1.

Example: Peru Ana María Huaita-Alfaro
