# Companies fostering a culture wellbeing

Corporate wellness programs, despite generating an $8 billion industry and covering over 50 million U.S. workers, have largely failed to deliver on promises of improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs, as definitively demonstrated by the 2019 Illinois Workplace Wellness Study showing no significant effects on medical spending, productivity, or health behaviors. While select programs like Johnson & Johnson's showed positive ROI ($2.71 per dollar invested), systematic reviews revealed that apparent successes were often artifacts of selection bias, with healthier employees self-selecting into voluntary programs, and that only 2% of employers could provide actual cost-savings data. The fundamental failure of workplace wellness stems from treating health as an individual responsibility while ignoring structural workplace factors—such as shift work, job stress, and limited healthy food access—and from generic program designs that fail to accommodate the diverse needs of different worker populations, particularly blue-collar and shift workers.


## Current Model of the Topic
### Base Mental Models & Structures
- Health programs in the work environment becomes a norm (health risk assessments)
- Food Perks or food machines as a cultural and space benefit
- HR interested in internal culture as retention and motivation

### Based Interventions Models
- Wellness cultures that demonstrate measurable returns on investment. 
- Comprehensive wellness programs with nutrition components

### Present State
Assumed programs would help those who needed it most to change habits

One program fits all employees

Overemphasis on individual responsibility, neglecting the importance of sustained organizational and environmental support.




## Transition

### Past of the topic
Assumed programs would help those who needed it most to change habits

### Behavior change Triggers
- Older teenagers and young adults
- 30s and 40s

### Future of the Topic
- Need to address structural workplace issues, not just individual behaviors
- Environmental modifications (e.g., healthier menus, strategic food placement, price discounts) increased uptake of healthy options

### Long Term Goal
Corporate wellness behaviors promoting healthy food transitions  that moves from the inside to the outside of the organization. While making sure that this effect reaches wide scale collaborators during critical decision-making moments throughout the day.
