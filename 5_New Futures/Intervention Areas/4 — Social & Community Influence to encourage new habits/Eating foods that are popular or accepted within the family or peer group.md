## Behavior:
Eating foods that are popular or accepted within the family or peer group



### How:
Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) Groups - Local food-sharing programs that connect consumers directly with farmers, creating community around seasonal, local eating while supporting sustainable agriculture.
