# Social & Community Influence to encourage new habits

Community-based interventions leveraging social networks for dietary change showed promise when built on existing community structures and peer support models, yet consistently demonstrated small effect sizes in low-income populations where structural barriers overwhelmed programmatic efforts. The prevailing bias that short-term community programs (typically 6-12 weeks) could create lasting behavior change was repeatedly disproven, with improvements disappearing at follow-up, while top-down program design without meaningful community input resulted in poor cultural fit and high dropout rates. Most critically, single-dimension approaches focusing on either education or access alone failed uniformly, demonstrating that effective community interventions must simultaneously address multiple social determinants, ensure sustained duration and intensity, and center community voice and ownership from inception through implementation.

## Current Model of the Topic
### Base Mental Models & Structures
- Health programs in the work environment becomes a norm (health risk assessments)
- Online social networks shape dietary behavior through perceived consumption norms
- Social media campaigns and influencer partnerships

### Based Interventions Models
- Digital communities and social media platforms increasingly shape food choices
- Network effects and food choice cascades operate through informational cascades &  social validation seeking

### Present State
Limited impact when basic needs unmet

Addressing one barrier (e.g., knowledge OR access) would be sufficient

Overlooking the role of social class, culture, and context in shaping food choices.
