[[Social & Community Influence to encourage new habits]]

# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
Aesthetic Health Signaling
Connect healthy eating to visible markers of success—clear skin, energy, physique—that serve as social proof of good choices.

### How:
Consumers aspire to the beauty and body image of healthier food products. Highlight benefits of healthy whole foods through targeted influencer campaigns. Have influencers sample out the products in stores.
