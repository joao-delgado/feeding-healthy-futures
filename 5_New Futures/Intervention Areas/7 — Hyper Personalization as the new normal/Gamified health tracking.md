[[Hyper Personalization as the new normal]]

# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
Gamified health tracking
Healthy Eating Reward Reinforcement : 
Recognition points in supermarkets/apps for healthy eating achievements that provide social validation and personal satisfaction at meaningful intervals.



### How:
Supermarkets chains can provided a weekly or monthly summary of purchases broken down into categories for consumers to review and then create promotional savings on their favorite healthy items.
