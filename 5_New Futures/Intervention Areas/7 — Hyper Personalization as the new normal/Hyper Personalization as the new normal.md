# Hyper Personalization as the new normal

The rapid commercialization of personalized nutrition through direct-to-consumer genetic testing and AI-powered applications from 2015-2024 exemplified premature market entry before scientific validation, with most gene-diet interactions failing replication in large studies like EPIC-InterAct. The fundamental bias that genetic information alone could determine optimal diets ignored the equal importance of environmental factors, microbiome composition, lifestyle variables, and social determinants, leading to oversimplified recommendations that lacked clinical validation through randomized controlled trials. Most concerning, the high costs of genetic testing and personalized services created a new form of nutritional inequality, where precision nutrition became a luxury good for affluent consumers while potentially widening health disparitiesâ€”revealing that true personalization must extend beyond genetics to address the full complexity of human nutrition within diverse social and economic contexts.


## Current Model of the Topic
### Base Mental Models & Structures
- Direct-to-consumer genetic testing for nutrition
- Trust the consumer the action of trace his own information
- Healthcare services on nutrition

### Based Interventions Models
- Metabolism information with reports
- diet apps
- Personalized meal planning services
- Genetic testing and personalized services unaffordable for most

### Present State
Increased consumer interest in personalized approaches
Oversimplification of Complexity




## Transition

### Past of the topic
Oversimplification of Complexity


### Behavior change Triggers
- Young Children and Parenting
- First Life Transitions
- 30s & 40s

### Future of the Topic
- Develop algorithms predicting individual responses to food and establish precision nutrition as mainstream medical care
- Future hyper-personalization trends include predictive analytics that anticipate nutritional needs before symptoms appear.

 
### Long Term Goal
Validate Personalization expectation: Support consumers increasingly expectation and demand for individualized nutrition recommendations based on personal data
