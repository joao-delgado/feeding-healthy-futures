[[Transition areas that fuel change]]

# **What behaviors could be stimulated to foster a transition to a healthier eating habit?**


## Behavior:
Influencing Peer Groups through New Subscriptions 


### How:
When someone signs up for a new (gym) subscription, get them involved in an accountability group, highlight and offer discount to preferred healthy food places, offer them a one time free nutrition consultation. Get them engaged in ways they did know about.
