## Key Feedback Loops
- **Rising Demand for Nutritional Transparency Fuels Health-Conscious Choices**: Consumers increasingly seek detailed nutritional information to guide their food decisions, driven by a desire to eat more mindfully and with greater understanding of what they consume.
- **Globalization gaps**: Globalization has led to a food system where food now comes from more unknown locations, leading to skepticism. If consumers trusted food brands, the need for transparency would be less of a consumer need. Most consumers don't want to spend valuable time determining these variables.
