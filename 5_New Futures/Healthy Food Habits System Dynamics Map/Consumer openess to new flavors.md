## Key Feedback Loops
- **Globalization of Healthy Food**: Globalization fosters an openness to a broader range of tastes and flavors, leading consumers to be more receptive to healthy food habits.
- **Reassessing Traditional Diets Through Culinary Fusion**: As global flavors are incorporated into mass-market products or fusion cuisine, the cultural and nutritional context of these ingredients is often readapted to the regional taste preferences. This is a reinterpretation of traditional food knowledge and may compromise their original recipe.
- **Globalization as a Gateway to Novelty and Health Consciousness**: Globalization expands taste palates and normalizes cross-cultural food consumption, increasing consumer openness to new flavors, ingredients, and potentially healthier food habits. This exposure supports dietary shifts, experimentation, and wellness-oriented consumption patterns.
