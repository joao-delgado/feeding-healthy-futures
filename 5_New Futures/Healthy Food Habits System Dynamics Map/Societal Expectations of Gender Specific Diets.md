## Key Feedback Loops
- **Effect of Social Constructs on Diets**: societal norms around gendered food alters the type of food consumed by a person just based on their gender. (E.g red meat for men, but red meat could also be good for women for iron content, which reduces thea option to eat food for nutrional value and increases bodily discernment and reduces influence of social media content
- **Cultural and Gender Norms Shape Food Perception and Access**: Social constructs around gender and food (e.g., meat for men, light meals for women) influence eating behavior and nutritional decisions, sometimes overriding individual health needs. These norms can obscure the role of bodily intuition and restrict food choice diversity.
