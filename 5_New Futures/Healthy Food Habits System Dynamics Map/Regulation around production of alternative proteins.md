## Key Feedback Loops
- **Vegism on alt meat**: The policy around food innovation globally can either block or enable new products to emerge on the market. Lab grown meat is only allowed in some countries and claims to be an innovation that can help supply a growing population with protein while reducing the effects of climate change from livestock farming.
- **Policy Gatekeeping in Global Food Innovation**: The development and availability of new food technologies—such as lab-grown meat—are shaped by national and international regulatory frameworks and influence of traditional meat industries. These policies can either catalyze or constrain innovation depending on their openness to scientific claims.
