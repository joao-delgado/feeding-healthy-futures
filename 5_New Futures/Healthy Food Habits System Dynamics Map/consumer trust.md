## Key Feedback Loops
- **Transparency as   Trust-Building Strategy**: In an era of health concerns and food skepticism, transparency is both a value proposition and a way to build consumer trust. Brands that clearly communicate sourcing, quality, and ethical standards can build consumer loyalty. But without real comprehension, even transparency risks becoming performative.
- **The Datafication of Food Transparency**: As food systems become increasingly digitized, AI-powered tools (e.g., smart labels, blockchain, traceability platforms) are redefining how transparency is communicated. These tools shape trust and influence consumer decisions â€” especially around lab-grown foods, health safety, and ethical sourcing
