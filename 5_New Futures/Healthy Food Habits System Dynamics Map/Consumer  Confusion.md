## Key Feedback Loops
- **Labeling confusion**: Terms like 'high protein' and 'clean eating' can confuse consumers into knowing what exactly is in the product if they are unable to understand the ingredient list and know the impact it has on their bodies - leading to confusion or trust  on healthy food habits.
- **Confusion and information overload**: Information overload from multiple marketing channels (social media, tv, in-person advertising) with numerous claims and trends (e.g., high-protein, clean eating, functional beverages), consumers find it challenging to discern authentic and practical healthy eating advice. Marketing language and packaging design use psychological cues (e.g., "clean eating," "high protein," "light," "mega") to shape consumption — often reinforcing social constructs around gender, health, and body image. This creates confusion, particularly when consumers can't decode ingredient lists or nutrient claims.
