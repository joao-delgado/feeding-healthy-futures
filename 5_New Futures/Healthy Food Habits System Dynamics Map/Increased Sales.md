## Key Feedback Loops
- **Data Colonialism in Food Retail Platforms**: AI-driven platforms (e.g., Birdzi) gather vast consumer data to optimize sales, but rarely return power or insights to consumers. This raises concerns about data colonialism â€” where consumer behavior is mined, shaped, and sold without meaningful consent or reciprocity.
- **Retail Power, Platformization & Loss of Choice**: The shift to pre-packaged, algorithm-driven, and retailer-curated grocery shopping (especially online) reduces consumer agency and narrows product diversity. Supermarket private labels and AI-driven promotions push certain brands and sideline smaller producers, subtly controlling what we eat and how.
