# Food Waste

**Type:** Driver

**Properties:** None specified

## Description
Caused by overproduction.

Food waste is not just a byproduct—it’s a design feature of extractive agricultural systems. It upholds overproduction, justifies intensive land use, masks unsustainable practices, and reinforces unjust market structures. '

In 2011, the FAO presented the first global estimate: about one third of the edible parts of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted, which corresponds to about 1.3 billion tonnes of food per year. The waste is fairly well distributed in all countries and between the different levels of the food chain: 1/3 upstream (production), 1/3 downstream (at consumer level), 1/3 in between (distribution and processing).
