## Key Feedback Loops
- **Reimagining Celebration: The Holiday Revolution**: The re-adaptation of traditional dishes for holidays represents perhaps the most powerful intervention point in the system. Holidays are when food traditions are most deeply entrenched and when people are most resistant to change. Yet they're also when families gather, creating opportunities for collective transformation.
- **Upkeep traditional foodways**: While traditional knowledge systems like Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Indigenous foodways face erosion in some contexts, there is a concurrent desire to upkeep traditions through shared labor.
