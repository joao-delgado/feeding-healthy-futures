## Key Feedback Loops
- **Social Communities as Catalysts for Dietary Shifts**: Online food communities and hobby-driven collectives (e.g., sourdough, kombucha) foster shared learning and mutual reinforcement of dietary habits. These spaces can create supportive environments for adopting healthier behaviors, but may also be shaped by groupthink or trend-chasing.
- **Upkeep traditional foodways**: While traditional knowledge systems like Ayurveda, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Indigenous foodways face erosion in some contexts, there is a concurrent desire to upkeep traditions through shared labor.
