## System Role
Primarily acts as a reinforcing driver in the system

## Key Feedback Loops
- **Erosion and Adaptation of Intergenerational Food Rituals**: Traditional practices of intergenerational cooking and food preparation are increasingly disrupted by modern living arrangements, time constraints, and the availability of convenience foods. This weakens the transmission of culinary knowledge and collective food memory.
- **Reimagining Celebration: The Holiday Revolution**: The re-adaptation of traditional dishes for holidays represents perhaps the most powerful intervention point in the system. Holidays are when food traditions are most deeply entrenched and when people are most resistant to change. Yet they're also when families gather, creating opportunities for collective transformation.
