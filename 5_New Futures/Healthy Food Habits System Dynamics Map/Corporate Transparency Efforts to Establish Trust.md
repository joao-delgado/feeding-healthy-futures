## Key Feedback Loops
- **Labeling confusion**: Terms like 'high protein' and 'clean eating' can confuse consumers into knowing what exactly is in the product if they are unable to understand the ingredient list and know the impact it has on their bodies - leading to confusion or trustÂ  on healthy food habits.
- **Globalization gaps**: Globalization has led to a food system where food now comes from more unknown locations, leading to skepticism. If consumers trusted food brands, the need for transparency would be less of a consumer need. Most consumers don't want to spend valuable time determining these variables.
