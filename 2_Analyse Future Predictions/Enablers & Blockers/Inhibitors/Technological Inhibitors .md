# Technological Trend Inhibitors 

## 1-2 Years
- **Stressed Supply Chains**- The rapid growth of the online grocery market has brought with it significant logistical and supply chain challenges. As demand for online grocery shopping continues to rise, retailers face the complex task of efficiently managing inventory, ensuring product availability, and meeting delivery expectations. The perishability of many grocery items adds an additional layer of complexity, requiring robust cold chain logistics to maintain product quality from the warehouse to the consumerâ€™s doorstep. Delays, inventory shortages, and the inability to maintain product freshness can lead to customer dissatisfaction and lost sales, which perhaps affect the existence of grocery stores as a whole.
- **Low pick-up rate of technological advances**- Farmers are often bogged down and quite risk-averse to using technological advances on their products or farm
- **Misinformation & lack of verification-** As platforms like Meta and X continue to push algorithms in favor of engagement/virality and profits, it is less likely the a possibility of fact-checking or verifying the claims of influencers.

## 3-5 Years
- **Unhealthy Algorithm Promoting Bad Habits**- Algorithms are managed by tech companies focused on making profits. Hence, shopping online enables the algorithm to predict more unhealthy options for you based on your last consumption. Can increase the consumption of unhealthy eating habits by suggested posts, rather than what is good for you.
- **Pro-Biotics Golden Rush**- Pro-Biotics in everything, including food items, there is an unknown factor of how that affects us in the long term, maybe we form a resistance and are guts lose their immune functioning.
- **Infrastructure for food technology advancements**- Advanced food production technologies like 3D printing, big-scale fermentation, and synthetic biology require specialized technical capacity, creating a "sustainability divide" where only private organizations can afford such infrastructure.
## 5+ years 
- **Over-dependency on technology may cause sensorial loss**- The rise of bio-hacking tools or devices mandates a dependency on these tools to 'teach' us or 'show' us our bodily changes, versus being 'bodily discerning' of it. Technology mandates a healthy life so we are less likely to understand our discernment of healthy food habits.
- **Limited Technological Raw Material Resources**- To develop all of the necessary infrastructure and equipment for technologically advanced machines requires a huge amount of raw materials, including precious metals. The extractive nature and sheer availability of these resources is limited.
- **Unintended consequences of waste created by new technologies**-Novel technologies converting food byproducts into bioactive compounds[6](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/corporate_publications/files/publ081216trends,0.pdf)
