# Ecological Trend Inhibitors

[[Climate Change Issues ]] 


## 1-2 Years
- **Contaminant of Microplastics in Soil**- Microplastics degrade in the soil of crops due to the use of plastic tarps in farming for weeding or in the use of crop tunneling.
- **Climate change-induced disasters**- Global warming will continue to cause forest fires and a shift in crop production and yield
## 3-5 Years
- **Nutrient boundary overshoot in the hemisphere**-Global food systems exceed:
	- Planetary nitrogen boundary by 150%[1](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/)[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8755053/)
	- Phosphorus boundary by 400%[1](https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/)
	- Potassium depletion in 75% of agricultural soils
- **Contaminant accumulation pathways**
	- Heavy metals in crops from wastewater irrigation (affects 35M ha globally)[2](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/nutrition)[8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8755053/)
	- PFAS "forever chemicals" in seafood supply chains[2](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/nutrition)
	- Pesticide residues disrupting soil microbiomes
- **Biodiversity erosion cascades**
	- Monoculture-driven pollinator decline (75% crop types depend on animal pollination)[3](https://www.sustainableagriculture.eco/post/navigating-change-challenges-for-current-food-systems-to-embrace-sustainability) creates:
	- Reduced crop resilience to pests/diseases
	- Lower nutritional density in staple crops[4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.941842/full)
	- Increased dependency on synthetic inputs
- **Emerging climate-diet traps**-Quality of fish and seafood is nutrient poor now because of CO₂-induced nutrient dilution (zinc/iron in cereals ↓4-10% per 100ppm CO₂)[4](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.941842/full)
- **Climate change impacts commodity prices-** Companies will no longer absorb the price hike on coffee and chocolate caused by climate change-induced crop changes. This will change the way people snack, and they may go for alternative snacks that are more unhealthy
## 5+ years 
- **Re-occurrence of the potato famine on a global scale**- There could be a chance of a lack of food in the future to feed the masses, similar to the potato famine in Ireland, that many more people to go hungry.
