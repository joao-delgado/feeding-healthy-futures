## 1-2 Years
- **Pressure from social media**- As people are drawn to the allure of what's trendy and what's being posted on social media, they are less likely to pay attention to seasonality and the availability of what is good for them
- **Social Media Trends**- The proliferation of waste as influencers or people who want to be on trend buy food products just to be part of the excitement of something new. E.g, Dubai Chocolate, Fizzy Coke, cheese on instant noodles
- **Time Scarcity - Blue-collar workers or anyone with fixed schedules**- Upcoming trends around healthy cooperations, subscription models supermarkets are not favorable for those who have time scarcity (low flexibility) and low income.
- **Fixed lunch breaks increased food stress-** Fixed lunch hours make it difficult for workers to have dedicated times or options to eat well E.g mandated lunch hours based on labor laws, 1-2 pm lunch
- **Less home cooking & more eating out**- As people are drawn to the allure of restaurants and more available convenience foods, they are less likely to cook at home, which leads to a loss of knowledge on these topics
## 3-5 Years
- **Allocation of Income related to perceived value of wealth**- People are spending money on high-end named technological gadgets, lavish trips, and eating out, versus spending an equal proportion of their income on healthy food options at the supermarket
- **Right Wing Politics is getting widespread**- Right Wing (conservative) politics and its correlation to the way we eat. The way Europe is moving to more right-wing politics is a sign of the way this could affect the way we eat and the regulations around food that they approve and do not approve. (For an e.g, is alternative meat protein in their agenda, probably not)_ [Reference](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/meat-boom-trump-rfk-jr/682150/)
- **Aging population**- An aging population not supported by a younger generation fractures the pension possibilities, activities they can do or food they will be able to purchase
- **Extreme Dietary Personalization-** The specific personalization of food could become identity markers for people. E.g, Gluten-free eaters, vegan eaters, Atkins, caveman eaters
- **Hyper flexibility could change cultures and socialization**- The rise of non-specific meal times - flexibility to when one feels like it or in a social situation for it (allows for more bodily discernment) but effects local culture (for an e.g tea time or coffee time in Italy and Portugal are big part of socialisation and a sense of understanding the culture which erodes when people do things more individualistically!
- **Smaller families**- People are less and less likely to get married and have children, so having home-cooked meals becomes more relevant. Something traditionally associated with creating structure for a family and children. 
## 5+ years 
- 
- **Aging population, Loss of Knowledge** aging population is not supported by a younger generation. There is a loss of intergenerational knowledge, such as cooking techniques for heritage foods. E.g, buckwheat in Slovenia is now lost upon the younger generation, even though it was a staple during Yugoslavia
- **Dilution of global flavors**- With the advent of globalization, flavors from another part of the world are available for consumption in a local supermarket; however, this oftentimes comes at the dilution of the flavors or in the misrepresentation of these flavors. E.g Kimchi Humus
- **The dying taste palette**- People are so used to sweetened or chemically processed foods that they are unable to reconnect with diverse tastes - bitterness, sourness, astringency, etc that make whole nutritious diets and foods.
- **Modern day migration**- Due to climate change, wars or even the possibility of digital nomad-ism, there is a big increase of people leaving their home countries in search of new places. Whilst this can be good, this also poses stress on the infrastructure of a place and the current import of food to meet the needs of this immigration.
