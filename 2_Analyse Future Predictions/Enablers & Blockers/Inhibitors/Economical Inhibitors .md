## 1-2 Years

- **Subsidy Paradox**- While current CAP payments in Europe offer _incentives_ for monoculture farming[3](https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/279916/1/A%20sustainable%20food%20system%20for%20the%20European%20Union_Libro2020.pdf), while global trade rules disproportionately advantage water-intensive crops from boundary-transgressing regions like China's nitrogen-exporting agricultural sector[4.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504541/) This encourages mass-agricultural produce from one region of the world, de-prioritizing local produce.
- **Global Trade Disruptions-** Tariffs, reducing global trade and the ability for exports and imports of products to happen, and reducing availability. E.g. US and also EU-Mercosur Agreement*
- **Distribution Monopolies**- Through consolidating distribution channels at supermarkets for efficiency and economies of scale, the biodiversity and options decrease. Reducing the company’s access to local fresh seasonal food options. E.g Sodexo 
- **Private Label Brands**- Retail companies focus on their own brands to control supermarket shelves and, to some extent, influence what consumers buy. E.g, Continental owned brands for everything, 365 (Wholefoods brand)
- **Trend labeling**- Using trends/viral ideas to capture the market. This is usually done by trend labeling products to gain more sales. E.g. Like low-fat, high-protein on a label to products in a way that confuses consumers into believing products are healthier than they seem.
- **Distrust in Food Quality-** Aquaculture increases the access of fish to consumers; however, in these environments, vaccinations are administered and feed needs to be manufactured. This leads to health concerns about the quality of the fish.
## 3-5 Years
- **Unregulated New Foods - Food Descriptors**- The rise of future drinks or extracting vitamins into water or food is not well documented or regulated at the moment, so we are all testing grounds for long-term consequences of these types of innovation. e.g, Functional Foods like Goddess Water, Lion Mane Mushroom powders, etc. Also, how the word 'natural' or 'bio' is plastered onto products without verification.
- **Tariffs affecting consumer prices-** Tarifs and wars with countries cause the prices of produce to increase E.g European high-quality tax products that Trump imposed on EU. The cost of cheese and wine on American consumers.
- **Price premium on nutrition-** There is and will continue to be a big price divide between what is nutritionally good for people and what is a premium. E.g Natoora sells 40 euros for 3kg of tomatoes versus 6 euros for 3kg of winter tomatoes in the supermarket
- **Online Supermarkets Propaganda-** The visibility of products on a retailer’s website through banners, promotions, and controlling the narrative and promotions of certain products on a grocery website is determined by the highest bidder (the brand willing to pay the most). E.g. Weee
## 5+ years 

- **Rich vs Poor Diets-** Bio-Hacking is going so far that access to food becomes limited to only the rich, based on everything being manufactured rather than grown or raised. There is a limited supply.
- **The end of the supermarket**- Cutting out the relationship with suppliers, there would be a lack of connection to the produce. Instead, the middle man through subscription boxes - if the future is subscription meals, then what will happen to farmers’ markets? E.g Blue Apron, Marley Spoon
- **Reducing the economic freedom of farmers**- Farmers lose economic power because a lot of the purchasing is further and further away from their control, to large corporations, as they buy out the land rights.
