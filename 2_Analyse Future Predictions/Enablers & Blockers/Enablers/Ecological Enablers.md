## 1-2 Years
- **Mass zero waste distribution-** Zero waste meal prep, or actual meals. Think Zero Waste stores for home delivery. Think Body Shop or Lush for food. E.g. Refundable 1 euro beer cup in Germany, Multi-Use vs. Single Use 
- **Microplastic awareness in food contamination**
- **The Quality of The Soil**-Punchier Produce. Some of the new offerings emphasize nutritional advantages and highlight the quality of the soil they are grown in. Others are pure flavor plays. “We have seen an incredible interest in seed development and the search for flavor and sustainable growth.” Social media will play a role, too, in accelerating demand for new or lesser-known fruits and vegetables.
- **Sustainable packing innovation -**like Notpla, ecovative, Paperfoam are good examples of bio-degradable packaging options that overcome the issue of microplastics in our food

## 3-5 Years** 
- **Reduction in Antimicrobial Use in Food Production**- The global concern over antimicrobial resistance is driving significant changes in food production systems. By 2030, we can expect stricter regulations and consumer demand to substantially reduce antimicrobial usage in food-producing animals. This trend responds to mounting evidence that widespread use of veterinary antimicrobials drives resistance with important consequences for both animal and human health. Current projections suggest global antimicrobial usage will reach approximately 104,079 tonnes by 2030, reflecting an 11.5% increase from 2017 levels despite growing awareness of their negative impacts8. This relatively modest increase (compared to earlier projections) indicates that antimicrobial stewardship efforts are gaining traction, particularly in major markets like China, though continued vigilance remains essential as animal protein demand continues to rise globally.
- **Community-backed Co-living**- Community-backed co-living housing & cooking, which enables larger of purchases. E.g, Galician co-living (Anceu Coliving) in the rural areas to repopulate the otherwise deserted areas.
- **The Next Big Certification** ROC (Regenerative Organic Certified) is on the rise and was all over the show: Ice cream, coffee, cheese, jerky, fruit, tea. Unlike standard organic certification, ROC prioritizes soil health, biodiversity, and farmworker fairness, and appears headed for greater growth.

## 5+ Years 
- **Semi-Permanent Food-Centered Living**- Novel residential concepts combining housing with immersive food experiences will emerge by 2030, reflecting broader trends in experiential living. The themed entertainment industry is already projecting "semi-permanent living options" at favorite attractions and resorts. This concept will extend to culinary-focused residential developments featuring on-site food production, specialized restaurants, and educational programming. These communities will attract consumers who prioritize food as a central lifestyle element, willing to make housing decisions based on access to specific culinary ecosystems. While remaining a niche market, these developments will influence broader residential amenity expectations around food access and quality.
