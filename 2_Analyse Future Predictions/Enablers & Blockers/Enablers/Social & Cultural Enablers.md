## 1-2 Years
- **Tribal Diets**- Food allergies are becoming a point of connection rather than ostracization. With the encouragement of various diets, especially vegan and vegetarian, it allows for more options for consumers, especially around diets that are proven to be low in Carbon Emissions (lower protein diets) - Eg, Glutery Bekery in Barcelona, Gluten-free events 
- **Carbon Emissions Transparency**- Carbon footprint awareness will fundamentally reshape food preferences by 2030, with consumers routinely factoring climate impact into their purchasing decisions. Industry projections suggest that over 60% of global consumers will prioritize sustainability when making purchasing decisions by 20303. Food producers will respond with comprehensive carbon accounting throughout their supply chains, providing detailed emissions information at the point of purchase. This trend extends beyond simple carbon footprint labeling to encompass entire lifecycle assessments, enabling consumers to compare products based on their comprehensive environmental impact profiles rather than single metrics.
- **Family-Centric Food Experiences**- Despite increasing individualization in many aspects of life, shared food experiences will gain renewed importance as vehicles for family cohesion by 2030. Research examining how contemporary cuisine affects traditional foods and family ties highlights the social dimension of food choices beyond nutritional considerations9. This trend will manifest in growing consumer preference for products and dining concepts that facilitate meaningful social interaction, from meal kits designed for collaborative preparation to restaurant concepts optimized for shared dining experiences. The emotional and social aspects of food will receive greater emphasis in marketing and product development, acknowledging food's role in maintaining family connections.
- **Back to the Office**- Free Lunch Still Works to Bring Employees Back to the Office.  CNBC, "My view is that in the next five to 10 years, food benefits are going to be part of your employee benefits program just the way health insurance and a 401(k) are.”
- **Food Social Clubs**- Social aspect of food: more and more people are doing it to connect, define themselves - correlated to supper clubs
- **Globalocalization**- Like when Noma goes to Japan, Chefs use local ingredients with globalized specialties to create new food landscapes.
- **Affordable Luxuries**- Fine dining is now more accessible to home consumers. For example, Noma Projects brings the experience of the restaurant Noma into your home.
- **Preventive Health**- Diet-related health issues have created a growing adoption of eating patterns that support consumers’ long-term health.
- **Home-cooked/chef-cooked fine dining experiences**- within homes, so there is also an increase in high-quality ingredients & equipment for guests
- **Globalized Flavors**- People are becoming more open to exploring other nationalities’ cuisines other than their own. This expands global taste preferences and the adoption of new foods. E.g[.](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/article/t-t-asian-grocery-sf-20248303.php) [Largest Korean Supermarket opening in San Francisco](https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/bay-area-newest-korean-grocery-store-20228467.php)
- **Preventive Aging**- Concern over wellness* - aging population
- **Online Purchase Transparency**- Online Grocery Shopping can increase transparency in food products by allowing customers to see nutritional, sourcing, etc, online before making a purchase. Do not have the pressure of making this decision in a supermarket with limited time or information. - Shopping online enables the algorithm to predict healthier options for you based on your last consumption (given that it was a healthy food to start with)
- **Past Nostalgia**- Nostalgia for the time of the past - How were things in the past? Ode to nostalgic times of foods you ate growing up 
- **Visibility to Physical Health**- Greater visibility to exercise & movement, which bring awareness to healthy food adoption
- **Post Fine-Dining Restaurant Subscriptions**- Getting curated products produced by professional chefs and restaurants. Encouraging cooking at home. (Diogo to send more research) E.g.Noma Taste Buds 
- **JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out)**- Deliberate pivot away from external social engagements toward enriched home-based experiences, which influences more high tech home equipment e.g barista coffee machine, vacuum seal machines, sous vide bimbi, **Workplace Food Spaces**- More workplaces are worried about food conditions and offer spaces and conditions to eat healthy
- **Government Diet Support**- Darebin City Council in Victoria becoming the first Australian city to endorse the Plant Based Treaty, which urges alignment between food systems and climate goals
- **High Protein Rush**- “high-protein” was the number one ranked eating pattern from the IFIC 2023 _Food & Health Survey_ (at 18%, followed by mindful eating [17%], calorie-counting [12%], clean eating [12%], and intermittent fasting [12%]).
- **Alternative Alcoholic Beverages**- Going away from Alcoholic Beverages towards functional beverages. Hydrating with alternative beverages

## 3-5 Years 

- **The rise of postbiotics**-There could be an advance in gut health optimization that has advanced beyond probiotics and prebiotics to focus on postbiotics—compounds produced when probiotics break down prebiotic fiber.
- **Water-Energy-Food Nexus Awareness**-Food choices in 2030 will reflect growing consumer understanding of the interconnections between water usage, energy consumption, and food production. Research examining trends in regions like Spain's Axarquia demonstrates the increasing importance of balancing these three critical resources for sustainable development. Consumers will gravitate toward products and production systems demonstrating efficient resource utilization across all three dimensions, particularly in regions experiencing water stress or energy constraints. This holistic approach to resource management will reshape agricultural priorities and consumer preferences, elevating previously secondary concerns about water footprints to primary decision factors.
- **Children Only Dinners** SMAGENS TIME: Children-focused dinners started in Denmark! Adults are forbidden - children are encouraged to give feedback, taste, and talk about food, building a strong connection to nutrition from a young age. [https://www.smagenstime.org/](https://www.smagenstime.org/)
- **The Green Feminine Stereotype**- The idea of a healthy (green) diet being more feminine is incompatible with traditional views of masculinity. There is a cultural norm for masculinity to eat animal protein
- **Groceries straight to the office-** Workplace: Workers will be able to order their groceries straight to the office so they can take them home after their shift, saving them time from going to the supermarket or picking them up at the store. Last-minute items for a family dinner can be sent straight to the office or home if in proximity to a drop-off location.
- **Instant Global Gratification** Life moves fast, and so do today's consumers—but their tastes are more sophisticated than ever,” says Trendspotter Jeannie Houchins. “Specialty food makers are stepping up, offering grab-and-go and quick-prep options that bring bold, authentic flavors from around the world right to their hands. This trend opens up consumers’ flavor profile preferences as well as expectations.
- **Gender-Conscious Food Marketing** -Gender differences in food preferences and nutritional awareness will receive increasing attention in product development and marketing by 2030. Research indicates that women currently show greater recognition of organic food's health and nutritional advantages compared to men. Rather than reinforcing stereotypes, future approaches will acknowledge physiological differences alongside evolving gender roles, creating more sophisticated targeting strategies. The trend will manifest in gender-specific nutritional formulations, communication approaches tailored to different information processing preferences, and product formats addressing varying consumption contexts and priorities across gender identities.
- **Food Schedules Hyper Flexibility** -The rise of non-specific meal times - flexibility to when one feels like it or in a social situation for it (allows for more bodily discernment).
- **Cross-Cultural Culinary Fusion** -Globalization forces will continue to drive culinary exchange and innovation, leading to increasingly sophisticated fusion cuisines by 2030. This trend reflects broader patterns of cultural exchange accelerated by digital connectivity and global mobility. Unlike earlier waves of culinary fusion that often represented superficial combinations, next-generation fusion will demonstrate a deeper understanding of ingredient combinations, cooking techniques, and cultural contexts. Consumers will seek authentic cross-cultural culinary experiences that respect traditions while creating novel flavor profiles, leading to a more nuanced appreciation of global food cultures beyond exotic novelty.
- **Uncommon Food Places** -Bookshop bars: extending the F&B options into otherwise uncommon places. 3rd Spaces 
- **Revival of Authentic Culinary Heritage** Cultural identity expressed through food will gain renewed importance by 2030, leading to a renaissance of traditional culinary practices and recipes. This trend represents a counterbalance to globalization forces, as consumers seek authentic connections to cultural heritage through food choices. Research examining the tension between contemporary cuisine and traditional foods reveals growing concern about the potential loss of culinary traditions and their associated social benefits9. Consumers will increasingly value foods with authentic cultural narratives and historical significance, particularly those that strengthen family and community connections. This preference will drive demand for products with genuine cultural provenance rather than commercialized adaptations.

## 5+ Years 
- **Alternative Naming Directories**- Just like M*LK, there will be a wider dictionary of terms to describe foods from the alternative universe that will push regulatory bodies to expand the way we understand and name food
- **Aging Population Food Adaptations**- The global demographic shift toward older populations will significantly impact food preferences and product development by 2030. This trend, identified within the "powered-up people" megatrend affecting multiple industries, reflects changing physiological needs and consumption patterns with age. Food producers will respond with products addressing specific nutritional requirements of older adults while maintaining appealing sensory qualities and convenient preparation methods. The intersection of aging and technology will create opportunities for smart packaging, portion control innovations, and delivery systems designed specifically for older consumers, representing a major growth sector in developed economies with aging populations.

## Insights
Culture and Society play the largest part in eating adoption patterns. Based on our findings, we understand that eating has historically been a communal act. This evolutionary habit explains the heavy correlation between societal and cultural trends on food adoption habits.
