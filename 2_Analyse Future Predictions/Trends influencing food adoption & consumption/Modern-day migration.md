# Why are people migrating
##  climate change (wild fires, floods, etc)
Research presented at COP21 estimated that between 25 million to 1 billion environmental migrants could be displaced by 2050 due to climate impacts[6](https://www.mim.gov.it/documents/20182/472550/Ifad_EN_untold_story.pdf/b03db27b-d19e-4897-897e-8e725587d80b). These sobering figures reflect growing evidence that climate-related crop failures, livestock losses, and resource conflicts are already driving migration, particularly from vulnerable regions like the Sahel toward Europe[6](https://www.mim.gov.it/documents/20182/472550/Ifad_EN_untold_story.pdf/b03db27b-d19e-4897-897e-8e725587d80b).
## Wars (Ukraine- Russia, gaza-israel) 

Conflicts such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine have created immediate food security crises while displacing millions. Ukraine, previously a leading global grain exporter, saw its exports dramatically reduced when Russian military forces blocked Black Sea ports[4](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/how-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-further-aggravated-the-global-food-crisis/). Even with EU-established "solidarity lanes" for overland transport and the temporary UN-brokered Black Sea Grain Initiative, global food supply remains precarious since Russia's withdrawal from the agreement in July 2023[4](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/how-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-further-aggravated-the-global-food-crisis/).

 ### Transportation issues 
 The Russian invasion of Ukraine demonstrated how quickly conflict can disrupt global food security. Prior to the war, approximately 90% of Ukraine's agricultural exports traveled by sea. The blockade of Black Sea ports severely restricted grain exports, driving up global food prices and creating food security concerns for millions worldwide[4](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/how-the-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-has-further-aggravated-the-global-food-crisis/). Though temporarily addressed through alternative transport routes, the crisis revealed the fragility of global food supply chains.

 # Greener pastures (Higher income, digital nomadism)
 
 Higher standard of living (greener pastures - i.e the case of china being the largest outbound market of travellers) 

- **Non-EU migrants filled 64% of new EU jobs (2.7 million positions)** between 2019–2023, with many entering agricultural and food processing sectors experiencing labor shortages[3](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2024/211/article-A001-en.xml).
    
- Ukraine's refugee population (4 million under EU temporary protection) has been rapidly absorbed into EU labor markets, supporting food production continuity despite war-related disruptions[3](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2024/211/article-A001-en.xml).
    
- **Nomad workers** are influencing rural economies: 15 EU countries now offer digital nomad visas (up from 3 in 2020), with Greece and Italy attracting remote workers to regions combining agricultural heritage with tech infrastructure[2](https://www.lincolnglobalpartners.com/2025/02/27/digital-nomad-visas-in-europe-complete-2025-country-guide/)[6](https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2024-01/agricultural-outlook-2023-report_en_0.pdf).

- Chinese students continue to represent a significant demographic in international education, particularly in the United Kingdom. Despite an overall 16% decline in foreign student applications to UK universities in the 2024 academic year, Chinese student numbers have maintained growth, making them the largest international student group in many programs[1](https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2024-10-18/Chinese-students-bucking-trend-of-falling-university-numbers-1xNYK5X9X4k/p.html).

# Migration impacts on food systems

## Dietary Shifts and Consumption Trends

- **Meat consumption is projected to decline 12% by 2035**, driven by migrant-influenced preferences for plant proteins (+18% pulse demand) and EU sustainability policies[6](https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2024-01/agricultural-outlook-2023-report_en_0.pdf).
    
- Urban centers report **37% faster adoption of alternative proteins** in cities with high migrant populations, aligning with the EU's Farm to Fork strategy targets[4](https://eurocities.eu/latest/why-cities-must-be-part-of-europes-food-future/)[7](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/5-food-trends-2025).
    
- School meal programs in 12 EU countries now serve **23% more plant-based meals** through initiatives like SchoolFood4Change, directly impacting 600,000+ children[4](https://eurocities.eu/latest/why-cities-must-be-part-of-europes-food-future/).
    
## Urban Food Systems Transformation

- Cities account for **74% of EU food consumption**, with migration driving demand for:
    
    - **Ethnic food markets** (+14% annual growth since 2022)
        
    - **Short-supply-chain produce** (30% of Berlin/Paris fresh food now from peri-urban farms)
        
    - **24/7 food delivery infrastructure** catering to nomadic workers[4](https://eurocities.eu/latest/why-cities-must-be-part-of-europes-food-future/)[7](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/5-food-trends-2025).
- Municipal policies leverage migrant demographics:
    
    - Rotterdam's "Edible City" program allocates 15% of public land to migrant-led urban farms
        
    - Barcelona's food waste reduction initiative cut supermarket waste by 28% using migrant community networks[4](https://eurocities.eu/latest/why-cities-must-be-part-of-europes-food-future/).
        
## Future Projections (2025–2030)

1. **Labor:** Migrants will fill **42% of EU agricultural jobs** by 2030 as native workforce ages (old-age dependency ratio projected at 52%)[3](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2024/211/article-A001-en.xml)[6](https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2024-01/agricultural-outlook-2023-report_en_0.pdf).
    
2. **Production:** Climate-resilient crops developed through EU-funded research (+€2.3B investment) aim to offset **17% yield losses** predicted from extreme weather[6](https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2024-01/agricultural-outlook-2023-report_en_0.pdf)[7](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/5-food-trends-2025).
    
3. **Consumption:** Cities plan to source **45% of food from regional suppliers** by 2030, with digital nomad hubs like Tallinn targeting 30% meal-kit market share for portable nutrition[2](https://www.lincolnglobalpartners.com/2025/02/27/digital-nomad-visas-in-europe-complete-2025-country-guide/)[7](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/5-food-trends-2025).
