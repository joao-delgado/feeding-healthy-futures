Global regulation on new food technologies in general:

As food technologies evolve, ensuring safety becomes more complex and critical. By 2034, regulatory frameworks will need to adapt to prioritise transparency and build consumer trust in lab-grown and alternative foods. Products like cultivated meat and precision-fermented proteins will challenge traditional safety standards, demanding new approaches to assess risks and maintain quality.

Advances in bioinformatics and "omics" technologies, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, will enable deeper and more robust safety assessments. These tools will allow regulators and manufacturers to identify potential hazards at a molecular level, ensuring that [novel food products](https://www.biosafe.fi/consulting-services/novel-foods) meet stringent global safety standards. Enhanced databases, predictive algorithms, and real-time monitoring systems will make it possible to detect and address safety issues before they reach consumers.

Artificial intelligence (AI) will revolutionise food quality inspection. AI-powered spectrometry, for example, can analyse the chemical composition of food with unprecedented precision, while electronic noses (e-noses) that mimic human olfactory senses can detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by food. These VOCs act as a “fingerprint” of freshness and quality, enabling quicker and more accurate detection of spoilage or contamination. Combined with automated sensors and blockchain technology, AI-driven systems can create an unbroken chain of quality assurance from production to plate, offering unprecedented safety

# EU's laws on alternative protein 

The European Union has recently undertaken significant revisions to its regulatory framework for novel foods, particularly focusing on alternative proteins. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has updated its guidelines for novel food applications including cell-based and fermented foods, with these changes taking effect for all applications submitted after February 1, 2025. This regulatory modernization aims to streamline approval processes while maintaining the EU's stringent food safety standards. A notable improvement is the establishment of a nine-month deadline for completing risk assessments, though this timeline pauses when additional information is requested from applicants[1](https://european-biotechnology.com/latest-news/efsa-updates-guidelines-for-cultured-proteins-and-novel-food/).

This update represents an important pivot for the European regulatory landscape, as previous EU approval timelines for novel foods ranged from 18 to 48 months—significantly longer than comparable processes in Singapore and the United States. The Good Food Institute, which advocates for alternative proteins, has welcomed these guidelines as responsive to industry needs while preserving the EU's "gold standard regulatory system"[1](https://european-biotechnology.com/latest-news/efsa-updates-guidelines-for-cultured-proteins-and-novel-food/). However, political challenges persist within the bloc, as evidenced by Italy's leadership under Giorgia Meloni challenging criteria for approving cultured meat, and Hungary's EU Presidency emphasizing protection of culinary traditions against novel foods[1](https://european-biotechnology.com/latest-news/efsa-updates-guidelines-for-cultured-proteins-and-novel-food/).

## Singapore's as an attractive player in the proteins game

Singapore has emerged as a global leader in alternative protein regulation, introducing the comprehensive Food Safety and Security Bill (FSSB) in March 2024. This legislation consolidates existing regulations to strengthen the country's food safety and security regime while formalizing procedures for novel food approvals[3](https://www.khlaw.com/insights/singapore-introduces-new-legislation-regulating-food-alternative-proteins-and-more). Under the FSSB, alternative proteins are classified as a sub-category of "Defined Food," which encompasses novel foods, genetically modified foods, and insect-like species requiring pre-market approval[3](https://www.khlaw.com/insights/singapore-introduces-new-legislation-regulating-food-alternative-proteins-and-more).

# Australia & NZ  - alt proteins as sustainable pathways

Australia and New Zealand have incorporated sustainability considerations into their regulatory approach for alternative proteins. Australia's Climate Change Authority has included alternative protein technologies in its net-zero transition pathways review, which will inform future climate change policies[5](https://www.foodfrontier.org/the-highs-and-lows-in-2024-for-alternative-proteins-in-australia-and-new-zealand/). This recognition signals growing institutional acknowledgment of alternative proteins' role in addressing environmental challenges.

The regulatory evolution in Australia has been complemented by local government initiatives, such as Darebin City Council in Victoria becoming the first Australian city to endorse the Plant Based Treaty, which urges alignment between food systems and climate goals[5](https://www.foodfrontier.org/the-highs-and-lows-in-2024-for-alternative-proteins-in-australia-and-new-zealand/). Additionally, sustainability considerations are being recommended for inclusion in Australia's Dietary Guidelines, potentially creating policy coherence between nutritional recommendations and environmental objectives[5](https://www.foodfrontier.org/the-highs-and-lows-in-2024-for-alternative-proteins-in-australia-and-new-zealand/).

# Global regulation for food procurement (WHO)

The World Health Organization has developed an action framework for implementing public food procurement and service policies that promote healthy diets[4](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-01-2021-who-urges-governments-to-promote-healthy-food-in-public-facilities). This institutional guidance emphasizes limiting sodium, sugar, and unhealthy fats while increasing consumption of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and pulses[4](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-01-2021-who-urges-governments-to-promote-healthy-food-in-public-facilities). Such frameworks provide a blueprint for policy development that will likely expand in scope and implementation over the coming decade.

## Global place-making of healthy food

The WHO explicitly states that "no public funds should be spent on food contributing to unhealthy diets," signaling an institutional commitment to leveraging public sector purchasing power to reshape food environments[4](https://www.who.int/news/item/12-01-2021-who-urges-governments-to-promote-healthy-food-in-public-facilities). As these policies proliferate across schools, hospitals, correctional facilities, and other public institutions through 2035, they will create significant market demand for nutritious options while exposing diverse populations to healthier eating patterns. This institutional demand provides stable markets for healthy food producers, potentially accelerating innovation and scaling production.
