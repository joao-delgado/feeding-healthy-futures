Between 2024 and 2030, food tourism is expected to be the fastest-growing segment of luxury travel, increasing at a CAGR of 7.6%. Appealing to travellers of all generations, luxury culinary travel includes trying out unique foods, visiting Michelin-starred restaurants, and attending food-related events such as cooking classes and festivals. 

According to surveys by Hilton, American Express, and Visa, travellers are prioritising local experiences, both in food travel and in general. Here are some statistics that stand out:

- **81% of travellers** are most excited about **trying local foods and cuisines.**
- **79% of travellers** like trying completely new food options while travelling.
- In 2023, over **half of world travellers** said their favourite culinary travel activity was **visiting local restaurants**. The next most popular activities were food festivals (46%), local food tours (41%), and wine tastings (39%). 
- In 2024, Gen Z and Millennials expressed interest in discovering the local bar scene.
- Compared to other generations, **Gen Z and Baby Boomers** were expected to budget the highest amount of money for **culinary experiences** and experience tourism
- **Chinese travelers** are estimated to be the **top spenders in the travel industry** in 2025 with a travel spend of $255.4 billion, followed by American ($134.1 billion) and German ($96.7 billion) travellers.
- Chinese tourism has demonstrated remarkable recovery following pandemic restrictions. By early 2023, Chinese outbound travel had already returned to 62% of pre-pandemic levels, with approximately 250,000 Chinese citizens traveling internationally daily, totaling around 7.5 million outbound travelers monthly[2](https://www.etoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Return-of-Chinese-Tourists-March-2023.pdf). The China Outbound Tourism Research Institute projected over 110,000 outbound flights from China in 2023, with forecasts suggesting Chinese border crossings would exceed 2019 levels by 2024, reaching 180 million[2](https://www.etoa.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-Return-of-Chinese-Tourists-March-2023.pdf). This massive movement of people represents a significant cultural and economic force.
