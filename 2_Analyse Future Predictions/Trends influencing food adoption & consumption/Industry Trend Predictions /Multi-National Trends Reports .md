What will land on our plates in the future? Food trends come and go faster than ever—yet some developments are more than just a fleeting hype. [Kitchen Stories ](https://www.kitchenstories.com/en/stories/future-menus-2025-unilever-reveals-the-food-trends-of-the-year)

To answer this question, **_Unilever Food Solutions_** analyzes global eating habits every year and presents the most important trends. One key takeaway from _Future Menus 2025_ is that **Asian flavors** are on the rise worldwide, while **traditional and regional techniques** are increasingly becoming part of **modern fine dining** concepts.

> Asian Flavors as a Universal Trend
> A common thread running through many of the current food trends is the growing popularity of Asian flavors. Whether it's **spicy fermentation**, **complex umami profiles**, or **traditional ingredients like miso, yuzu**, and **gochujang**—Asian flavor profiles are inspiring chefs worldwide. The delicate balance of sweetness, acidity, spice, and umami captures the current zeitgeist and enriches both classic dishes and modern fusion concepts. It’s no surprise that Asian influences are **playing a role in nearly all future food trends**.

> Trend 1: Streetfood Couture – Streetfood Meets Haute Cuisine
> Streetfood is evolving—**from a quick snack to a refined fusion of high-end cuisine** and authentic recipes. **High-quality ingredients** and **creative preparation techniques** are elevating the concept to a new level, with street food increasingly becoming **part of fine dining concepts**.

> Trend 3: Culinary Roots – Tradition and Regionality
> More and more chefs are returning to the roots of their **national cuisines** and **regional ingredients**. With **sustainability** in mind, regional recipes and traditional techniques are being revived—often with a **modern twist**.

> Trend 4: Diner Designed – Multisensory Dining as an Experience
> It has long been clear that food is more than just nourishment. This is also reflected in the hospitality industry: a visit to a restaurant should not only satisfy hunger but **engage all the senses**. **Light, sound, textures**, and even **interactive elements** are increasingly being used to intensify the taste experience. People are also **spending more money on experiences**, including dining out. Unilever concludes that the future of gastronomy lies in **multisensory enjoyment**.
