How Will We Eat in 2025? 9 Predictions to Chew On,[ New York Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/dining/food-eating-predictions-2025.html?searchResultPosition=1)
> **A Year of Sauces:** watch for more nuanced and culturally specific sauces as diners continue “on their global flavor journey,” said Emily Murphy, director of specialty merchandising at the specialty food company [Baldor](https://www.baldorfood.com/).
> 
> **Coffee’s Next Act**: coffee is starting to get the [omakase treatment](https://www.baristamagazine.com/embrace-the-zen-of-coffee-at-the-omakase-experience-at-cokuun/), in which customers are offered several courses of the drink in various preparations.
> 
> **Grab-and-Go Gastronomy**: [Gas stations](https://retailwire.com/discussion/convenience-stores-fast-food/) are preparing [made-to-order meals,](https://eatingwitherica.com/2017/10/racetracs-new-digs/) selling their own brand of frozen foods, stocking salads with local produce, and creating coffee bars with as many opportunities for customization as Starbucks.
> 
> **A Warming Trend**: Hotels and restaurants are using [A.I. and data analytics](https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4125209.html#:~:text=Final%20Thoughts,thrives%20in%202025%20and%20beyond.) to make service more personal. Look for cozy counter service, soulful food served in comfortable dining rooms and shorter menus that mix value and deliciousness. Restaurants that connect to the community and offer work-life balance for employees will matter more than ever.
> 
> **Punchier Produce**: Some of the new offerings emphasize nutritional advantages and highlight the quality of the soil they are grown in. Others are pure flavor plays. “We have seen an incredible interest in seed development and the search for flavor and sustainable growth,” said Jon Hansburg, director of food service sales at Baldor. Social media will play a role, too, in accelerating demand for new or lesser-known fruits and vegetables.

> **Another Dose of Protein**: Food manufacturers have started highlighting the protein content on packages of cereal, chips and other products.
> 
> **Buzzes Without Booze**: Drinks spiked with cannabis and other mood-altering components like kava, guarana and a brain-calming amino acid known as GABA will explode as interest in alcohol declines, especially among Gen Zers.
> 
> **Tribal Diets**: Food allergies are becoming a point of connection rather than ostracization. “Micro-communities are popping up that allow people with food allergies to say, ‘I see you and you’re cool with me,’” said Ms. Bartelme of Mintel.

> **Takeout as Art** 
> As the world of takeout and delivery continues to expand, so do the containers it comes in. Restaurants will up their game with thoughtful, Instagrammable packaging that lends itself to unboxing videos and can serve as a fun focal point for entertaining at home!
