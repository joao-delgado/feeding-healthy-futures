2025 ExpoWest Recap![[Screenshot 2025-03-12 at 12.51.29 PM.png]]
ExpoWest was pure chaos - more products, more brands, more people. As the dust and my over-sampled stomach settle, these are a few of my takeaways from this years show:  
  
💪 No Protein to be Found.  
Just kidding—protein was in everything. Protein bread, chips, pretzels, popcorn, dips, fortified nuts, yogurt, pasta, pasta sauce, mac & cheese, energy drinks, and even water. Protein is being pushed into every corner of CPG in an effort to reinvent and disrupt.  
  
🥤 Soda's About to Pop  
Olipop and Poppi skipped the show, but their presence was felt everywhere. New-age sodas flooded the floor—Slice made a comeback, Spindrift launched a soda, Sparkling Ice debuted Popwell, and Bloom jumped in. The soda bubble is here - will it burst like plant-based meat?  
  
🤯 Over-Functioned  
Many beverage brands are mimicking supplements, stacking multiple functions or offering several different functions within a product line as a means of innovating. The result? A lot of consumer confusion IMO. While hydration + energy or beauty + focus might sound compelling, most successful beverage brands win by owning a single, clear benefit.  
  
🌱 The Next Big Certification  
ROC (Regenerative Organic Certified) is on the rise and was all over the show: Ice cream, coffee, cheese, jerky, fruit, tea. Unlike standard organic certification, ROC prioritizes soil health, biodiversity, and farmworker fairness - and appears headed for greater growth.  
  
🌶️ Sauce Surge  
The condiment craze, fueled by Bachan, Truff & Sriracha, continued with bacon-blended hot sauce, tangy sauerkraut sauce, danish mustard, tahini dressings and Caribbean-Vietnamese Hot Sauce. Flavortown is everywhere.  
  
🇺🇸 Tariff Tensions  
Tariffs were on the tip of many tongues, frustrating many in a global economy. It's also leading some to tout their American made/grown/sourced products. Beyond US dairy, meat and eggs, we saw [CatSpring Yaupon](https://www.linkedin.com/company/catspringyaupon/) promote "America's only native caffeine." Lookout for more USA.  
  
🎨 Radical Rebrands & Color  
There were some major branding overhauls this year— Back to Nature, Archer, Glutino, Simply Protein, Unbun, Chameleon Cold Brew and more went all-in on rebrands. Many of those embraced full color-shifting packaging to better lead with flavor, maximalism branding and category disruption, creating a rainbow across every aisle.  
  
🧪 Wild Innovation  
Weird, wild and imaginative innovation was hiding throughout the show:  
- Dates coated in wild candy flavors like sour watermelon, cola and PB  
- "Chocolate" made from Mesquite  
- "Caviar" made from chia seeds  
- Dairy-free egg yogurt from upcycled, pasture-raised eggs  
- Protein charged almonds enrobed in collagen peptides  
- Chickpea Oatmeal with more protein than oats  
  
Other nods:  
🥒 Pickle/Dill flavor profiles everywhere!  
🍄 Continued rise of mushrooms-fortified products  
🧠 Brain benefits across beverage and bars  
🍺 Non-alc continues to expand (Bero, Best Day, De Soi, Jas)  
🌍 Amazing global foods/flavors with minority/BIPOC founders
