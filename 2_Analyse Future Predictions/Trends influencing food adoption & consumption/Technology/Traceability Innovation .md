# Blockchain in Food Supply  

[Foodchain](https://foodchain.se/en/about-us/)
## What is blockchain?
> A blockchain is a decentralized data storage platform that provides new opportunities for secure storage and tracking of data. The technology also enables several actors to share collective data in an unbroken chain. It is extremely suitable for, but still relatively unused in the food production industry. At present, blockchains are much more commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry and the financial world. But FCB’s goal is to establish the blockchain as an opportunity for food producers to make their production transparent by enabling tracking throughout the whole process and allowing producers to convey added value to the end consumer.
> 
> The blockchain provides completely new opportunities for communication throughout the production chain, from farmers to processors and finally to consumers. At the same time, the blockchain facilitates the administration and control of the farmer and the breeder over their production.
## Why use Foodchain by Blockchain?
> FCB is a revolution in the food industry. If you are looking for a real game changer when it comes to food production and what you really know about it, FCB is your solution.

FCB helps the producer to tell the story about the food to the consumer. The full, complete and true story!
