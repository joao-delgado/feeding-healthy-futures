> Interesting note with impressive numbers. Just two quick points: first, maybe we should update the information with the latest report (from 2024—the one I shared on Slack). Second, I think we should explore the emergence of platforms such as:

> In recent years, these platforms have become increasingly popular, allowing everyone to access knowledge from the world's best chefs.
# Pedagogical Innovation in Digital Culinary Education

## Beyond Recipes: Technique-Focused Learning

Unlike recipe-centric content commonly found on social media and food blogs, these premium platforms emphasize fundamental techniques and culinary principles. YesChef explicitly states they are for people who are "tired with blindly following recipes and want to learn techniques, skills and knowledge"[2](https://yeschef.me/classes/asma-khan-teaches-her-indian-cuisine). This approach aims to create more adaptable, confident cooks rather than those who can simply follow instructions.

The curriculum design is intentional and comprehensive, with YesChef classes including "around 12 video lessons that are 22 minutes long on average (7-40 minute range), plus an hour-long cinematic documentary film about the life, food and culture of each chef and location"[2](https://yeschef.me/classes/asma-khan-teaches-her-indian-cuisine). This structured approach contrasts with the often fragmented and inconsistent content on social media platforms.

PastryClass takes this technical focus even further, featuring "3 very complex and technical plating desserts with over 40 recipes that you can fully adapt"[3](https://www.pastryclass.com/jordiroca). This level of detail and technique is rarely found in free online content, positioning these platforms as advanced educational tools rather than casual entertainment.

## From Social Media to Social Learning

While traditional social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok offer abundant cooking content, these premium platforms create a different kind of social learning experience. Rather than the brief, often simplified content designed for viral appeal, these platforms emphasize depth and mastery.

[[Social Media's Impact on Food]] 

Social media's influence on eating behaviors operates through several psychological mechanisms that are likely to intensify in the future. The study found that participants' views about foods were moderately affected by their inclusion on social media platforms, with exposure to such content increasing their desire to consume these foods[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11334855/). This suggests a direct pathway through which digital content shapes food cravings and preferences. Interestingly, the research revealed that abstaining from social media might reduce time allocated for eating, indicating that platform usage may be extending meal durations—a finding with potential implications for mindful eating practices and consumption volume

## Insights


- According to IFIC’s [data](https://foodinsight.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IFIC-2023-Food-Health-Report.pdf), as a result of social media content, half of Americans (51%) say they have tried a new recipe, 42% say they have tried a new brand or product, 29% say they have tried a new restaurant, and 28% say they have reevaluated their relationship with food. Six in ten say they have made healthier choices as a result of information they see on social media. Phillips notes, “If we’ve learned anything, it’s to not underestimate the power of social media in influencing what people are eating, cooking and buying.”
- The engagement patterns across social platforms reveal the emergence of specialized healthy food communities focusing on specific approaches or dietary patterns. More granular hashtags such as "healthyfoodie" (774,153 posts), "healthyfoodideas" (357,860 posts), and "healthyfoodrecipes" (352,931 posts) indicate consumers are actively seeking and sharing practical implementation strategies for healthy eating[5](https://best-hashtags.com/hashtag/healthyfood/). The phenomenon of "WaterTok", which garnered over 960 million mentions on TikTok in 2023, exemplifies how even basic hydration behaviors can become viral social phenomena[1](https://foodinsight.org/food-trends-2024/). Through 2035, these digital communities will likely become increasingly influential in normalizing and accelerating healthy food adoption across demographic segments.

- [FMI, Mar 2025](https://www.fmi.org/newsroom/latest-news/view/2025/03/07/fmi-s-power-of-produce-2025--social-media-and-ecommerce-boost-produce-consumption) – Today, FMI – The Food Industry Association  released _[The Power of Produce 2025](https://www.fmi.org/forms/store/ProductFormPublic/the-power-of-produce-2025)_ report for the seventh consecutive year at the [Southeast Produce Council’s Southern Exposure conference](https://seproducecouncil.com/events-networking/southern-exposure/). With 94% of produce shoppers actively using social media platforms and 36% discovering new fruits and vegetables through these channels, digital engagement, especially with younger shoppers, is proving to be vital.


# Future of social learning via these platforms:

Future culinary education will likely place increased emphasis on the nutritional and cultural contexts of cooking. YesChef already highlights how they take users "on a globe-trotting, mouth-watering culinary journey"[2](https://yeschef.me/classes/asma-khan-teaches-her-indian-cuisine), suggesting growing interest in understanding the cultural origins of dishes rather than just their preparation.

As health consciousness continues to rise, these platforms will likely expand their focus on nutritional education integrated with culinary techniques. While the current emphasis appears to be primarily on technique and flavor, market demands will likely push these platforms to address how traditional techniques can be adapted for contemporary health concerns.

Environmental sustainability is another area likely to gain prominence in future culinary education. As climate concerns grow, platforms that currently focus on culinary tradition and technique will likely incorporate more content on sustainable sourcing, seasonal eating, and reducing food waste.

**Platform Example** 
	**[Kitchen Stories](https://www.kitchenstories.com/)** is a video-based, cross-media cooking platform, available as an app, website, on smart TVs or via Amazon Echo Show. In addition to getting free recipes for every occasion, HD video tutorials and inspiring articles, users can also upload their own culinary creations to the platform and share them with the global community.


**The shift of Influencers teaching cooking versus Martha Steward Types**: 
This shift toward more relaxed culinary education potentially signals a future where cooking is increasingly viewed as a creative outlet and source of pleasure rather than merely a domestic obligation, possibly influencing product development in kitchen tools and ingredients designed for enjoyable rather than purely efficient cooking experiences.
