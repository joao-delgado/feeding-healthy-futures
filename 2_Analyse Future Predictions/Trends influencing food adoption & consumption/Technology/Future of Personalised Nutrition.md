# Inudstry Predictions

[[Personalized Packaging Food]]
The personalized nutrition market is experiencing substantial growth, having reached approximately $9 billion in 2021 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10%[6](https://digital.teknoscienze.com/agrofood_industry_hi_tech_34_1_2023/personalised_nutrition_an_industry_in_the_making). More optimistic projections suggest the industry could more than double from $8.1 billion in 2020 to $19.7 billion by 2027[7](https://www.foodinspiration.com/us/will-the-market-for-personalized-nutrition-reach-maturity-in-2023/). This growth reflects increasing consumer interest in health personalization, with 39% of US consumers prioritizing spending on wellbeing more than they did a year earlier, despite economic challenges[6](https://digital.teknoscienze.com/agrofood_industry_hi_tech_34_1_2023/personalised_nutrition_an_industry_in_the_making).

The segment showing particularly strong growth is personalized nutrition supplements, which grew by 35.8% in 2021 alone according to industry data[6](https://digital.teknoscienze.com/agrofood_industry_hi_tech_34_1_2023/personalised_nutrition_an_industry_in_the_making). This rapid expansion indicates a shift toward more targeted nutritional solutions that address individual needs rather than general supplementation.

It began with a laser focus on DNA analysis, which has now been proven to be only a piece of the puzzle. This evolved into a second phase that included a systems approach and more holistic advice, enabled by new technologies and the use of Artificial Intelligence. Today, the market is moving into a third phase, with recommendations now being supported by behavior change techniques to ensure people develop lasting healthier eating habits.)

# Concerns in future adoption 

Experts believe a "flourishing personalized nutrition ecosystem" is needed to empower consumers to change their dietary behaviors on a meaningful scale[7](https://www.foodinspiration.com/us/will-the-market-for-personalized-nutrition-reach-maturity-in-2023/). This ecosystem would require integration across various sectors, bringing together tech companies, diagnostic firms, food producers, retailers, healthcare providers, and insurers to create a connected experience for consumers[7](https://www.foodinspiration.com/us/will-the-market-for-personalized-nutrition-reach-maturity-in-2023/).

Industry experts emphasize that cross-sector collaboration is essential for overcoming value chain challenges and accelerating growth in personalized nutrition[7](https://www.foodinspiration.com/us/will-the-market-for-personalized-nutrition-reach-maturity-in-2023/). Without this integrated approach, personalized nutrition services may remain fragmented and difficult for consumers to incorporate into their daily lives.

# Personal Nutrition is empowerment?

Nutritional scientist Nard Clabbers frames personalized nutrition as "a form of empowerment" that helps consumers improve their diet through informed choices[7](https://www.foodinspiration.com/us/will-the-market-for-personalized-nutrition-reach-maturity-in-2023/). This perspective highlights that the value of personalized nutrition extends beyond the technology itself to the behavioral changes it enables.

For these services to be truly effective, they must successfully bridge the gap between providing information and facilitating sustainable dietary changes. Companies like ZOE, Lumen, and Tessa's Meal Prep Service approach this challenge from different angles—through scientific insights, real-time metabolic feedback, and practical meal delivery, respectively—but all aim to make healthy eating more accessible and sustainable.


# EXAMPLE of GOOD PERSONALISED NUTRITION COMPANIES

## ZOE

ZOE is a leading London-based science and nutrition company redefining personalised nutrition by combining scientific research and machine learning.

### Problem ZOE is trying to solve

Wolf emphasises that ZOEs’ competition lies in changing how society views nutrition. “We’re competing with an outdated worldview, where people think food is just calories, or that you shouldn’t eat high-fat foods because it’s bad for you,” he explains. This reflects the company’s larger ambition to reshape public understanding of nutrition and challenge misconceptions around diet and health.

Zoe's long term goals  is to lead the shift towards more personalised, data-driven health solutions. The company now has over 100k members and has recently had the results of its randomised control trial published in Nature Medicine, which proved the programme's effectiveness.

### How effective is zoe?? - its power is in personalisation

The researchers concluded that when people received personalized nutrition advice, they were more likely to improve their diets than those who received more general guidance. 

One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27524815/) in particular, involving over 1,200 participants, found that those who received a 6-month personalized nutrition intervention went on to eat less red meat, salt, and saturated fat, and saw greater improvements in their overall diet than those who received general nutrition advice.
