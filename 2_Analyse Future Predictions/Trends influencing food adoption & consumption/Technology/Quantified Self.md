# What is the quantified self?

[[Bio-hacking]]

The Quantified Self movement is self knowledge through numbers." This refers to a quantitative approach of getting to know yourself — and improving upon what you find out.

Nowadays, this is possible thanks to a host of tracking technologies and devices that compile the data into insights about various aspects of life — diet, physical activity, sleep patterns, mental health, and more. Almost anything can be tracked and measured.

The widespread adoption in recent years of wearable fitness and sleep trackers such as the [Fitbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitbit "Fitbit") or the [Apple Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch "Apple Watch"),(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self#cite_note-2) combined with the increased presence of [Internet of things in healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things#Medical_and_healthcare "Internet of things") and in exercise equipment, have made self-tracking accessible to a large segment of the population.
# Community through tracking

In the second meaning, the Quantified Self refers to the global community of self-trackers who rely on data collection as a way of improving themselves but also of [communicating with each other](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1067710?journalCode=rics20). Often, they use new technologies (such as Fitbit, Nike+ activity trackers, smart watches, and others) to gather and share relevant data. The Quantified Self movement has spread across the globe and members communicate through forums and blogs as well as online and offline meetups.


## Insights to personalised nutrition & wearable technology

According to Deloitte's 2022 Connectivity and Mobile Trends study, approximately 60% of US consumer households already own wearable devices, either smartwatches or fitness trackers. The overwhelming majority (87%) of these wearable owners actively use their devices to track health metrics including heart rate, workout duration, and sleep qualityhttps://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/wearable-technology-wellbeing-health-nutrition.html. This high level of engagement demonstrates that consumers have already embraced the concept of technology-assisted health monitoring as part of their daily lives.


# Where to expect the boom in this (APAC and North America) 

The financial projections for personalized nutrition technology indicate a rapidly expanding market opportunity. The Global Digital Personalized Nutrition Market was valued at USD 0.59 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 1.57 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate of 17.72%[5](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/global-digital-personalized-nutrition-market-outlook-6bawe). This substantial growth trajectory reflects increasing consumer interest in tailored nutritional approaches and the technological capabilities to deliver them.

Geographically, North America currently holds the largest market share for personalized nutrition products and services, likely due to higher disposable incomes and earlier technology adoption[4](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250114780224/en/Personalized-Nutrition-Global-Research-2024-2030-Technological-Advances-Such-as-Hyper-personalized-Nutrition-Based-on-Real-time-Biomarker-Analysis-to-Reshape-the-Market---ResearchAndMarkets.com). However, the Asia-Pacific region is expected to experience the highest growth rate as consumer awareness expands[4](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250114780224/en/Personalized-Nutrition-Global-Research-2024-2030-Technological-Advances-Such-as-Hyper-personalized-Nutrition-Based-on-Real-time-Biomarker-Analysis-to-Reshape-the-Market---ResearchAndMarkets.com). This geographic diversification suggests that personalized nutrition technology will become increasingly global rather than concentrated in developed economies, creating broader market opportunities for innovative companies in this space.

# Post blood glucose monitoring (what's next)

The next generation of wearables is expected to track additional biomarkers relevant to nutrition, potentially including cholesterol levels, vitamin concentrations, hydration status, and inflammatory markers. Thes## Hyper-Personalized Nutrition Through Real-Time Analysis

# From Data to  Detail 

Future wearable systems will not merely collect data but will analyze it in real-time to deliver immediate, actionable nutritional guidance. This capability enables what researchers term "hyper-personalized nutrition" – dietary recommendations that adapt continuously based on changing physiological conditions rather than static nutritional plans[4](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250114780224/en/Personalized-Nutrition-Global-Research-2024-2030-Technological-Advances-Such-as-Hyper-personalized-Nutrition-Based-on-Real-time-Biomarker-Analysis-to-Reshape-the-Market---ResearchAndMarkets.com).

The technical architecture supporting this capability involves wearable devices continuously monitoring biometric data including blood glucose levels, heart rate, physical activity, and potentially other biomarkers[6](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unlocking-future-nutrition-how-ai-revolutionizing-personalized-clrff). Artificial intelligence systems then analyze this streaming data to provide dietary recommendations that respond to the individual's current physiological state, recent activities, and longer-term health patterns[6](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/unlocking-future-nutrition-how-ai-revolutionizing-personalized-clrff). This dynamic approach represents a fundamental shift from historical nutrition models based on population averages and periodic assessments to continuous, individualized guidance that evolves with the user's changing biology.e capabilities will provide increasingly comprehensive insights into individual nutritional needs and responses, enabling unprecedented personalization of dietary recommendations.
