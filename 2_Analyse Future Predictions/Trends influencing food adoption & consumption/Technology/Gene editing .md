## **A genetic revolution on the table**

The European Union's role in this field will be pivotal. Gene editing technologies like CRISPR could reshape farming, creating crops more resistant to pests, diseases, and climate change. This could lead to both higher yields and more sustainable farming practices.

Gene editing also plays a crucial role in food biotechnology. CRISPR technology allows scientists to precisely modify the genetic makeup of microorganisms and cells, enhancing their ability to produce desired proteins and other compounds. This genetic optimisation is key to developing better, more efficient products. By improving the productivity and stability of these organisms, gene editing helps create more sustainable and scalable food production systems.
