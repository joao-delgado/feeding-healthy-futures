# Food Bioprocessing

[The Bioprocess of Food: A Journey from Farm to Fork](https://www.hilarispublisher.com/open-access/the-bioprocess-of-food-a-journey-from-farm-to-fork-104739.html)
> It is a dynamic and evolving field that combines biology, chemistry and engineering to transform raw agricultural products into the diverse array of food items we enjoy daily. From fermentation to enzymatic reactions, food bioprocessing plays a crucial role in enhancing flavours, extending shelf life and ensuring food safety. Food bioprocessing involves utilizing microorganisms, enzymes, or cells to produce desirable changes in food. It harnesses the power of living organisms and their biochemical pathways to bring about specific alterations in food properties. This can include fermentation, preservation and the enhancement of nutritional content [[1]


## Insights

So, in [the video ](https://youtu.be/z8zuqR95fqA?si=cdaM5-NT7xksvYrq)for Demystifying The Bioprocess of Solar Food, the guy says, 
“We are liberating food production from the constraints of agriculture.
Liberating Protein Production 
![[Screenshot 2025-02-20 at 4.10.28 PM.png]]
Jenny Dorsey said in our interview, “Food is becoming more privatized, increasing our consumer dependency on large corporations. (ex: Appeal, a manufactured coating to increase the shelf life of produce)

”We have a dichotomy here. Are we being liberated or constrained by these advancements when we intuitively understand that food closer to source is more nutrient dense?! 🤔
