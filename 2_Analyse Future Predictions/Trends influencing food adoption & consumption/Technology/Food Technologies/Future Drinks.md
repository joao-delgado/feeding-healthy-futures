# Adaptogens and Nootropics

As a matter of fact, adaptogens (usually herbs, roots, and mushrooms) are normally associated with [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] and [[Diaspora & migration|Diaspora & migration]] / [[Ayurveda]]

As for nootropics, the word literally means ‘mind-shapers’), However, nootropics are not limited to caffeine. Another very popular nootropic is _l-theanine_, mostly found in certain types of green and black tea leaves, and in some species of mushrooms. These amino acids are said to help your organism with stress-relief and relaxation.

Touted as the 'future of caffeine' it is basically designed to boost cognitive functions such as memory, focus, creativity and motivation. These drinks usually contain a mix of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and herbal extracts thought to support brain health and cognitive performance. 

(Think advanced redbull made from mushroom extracts or microdosing of molly!)

# Could this be the future?

- it definitely includes a lot of herbs, natural supplements which we may otherwise be lacking but these drinks also come with a lot of sugar and additives, so its unclear of the full health benefits

# Call for caution about nootropics

- **Unregulated ingredients:** The supplement industry is not as tightly regulated as pharmaceuticals, which can lead to issues with ingredient quality and dosage accuracy. 
- **Long-term effects:** The long-term safety of many nootropic compounds is not well-studied, and prolonged use could have unforeseen consequences. However, more research is needed to understand what effect there may be.

Data around nootropics:

The U.S. nootropic supplement market was valued at [$476.9 million](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/nootropic-supplements-market) in 2024 and is projected to experience a 7.9% CAGR through 2034. This growth is driven by increasing consumer awareness of brain health and cognitive enhancement. Research published by the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ demonstrated that [NAD+ supplementation](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1718819115) with nicotinamide riboside significantly improved learning, memory and motor functions in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model.
