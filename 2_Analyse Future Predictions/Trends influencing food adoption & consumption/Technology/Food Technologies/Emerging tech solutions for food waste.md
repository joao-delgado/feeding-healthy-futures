[[Waste in the Supply Chain]] is a huge issues, and tech is solving this problem at present day. The question is how effective is it, really and who is adopting it at the moment?

# FARMS

Some examples of food technology solving the problem of food waste created at farms:

- Apeel

Manufacturers have been waxing fruits and vegetables to improve their shelf-life since the 1920s, but California-based company [Apeel](https://www.apeel.com/) has taken the concept to new levels.

Apeel’s invisible, edible coating is made from wasted agricultural products like leftover grape skins from wine production. Apeel’s coating can extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables by five times!

- ### **Hazel Technologies**

Intended for fruit producers, [Hazel Technologies](https://www.hazeltechnologies.com/)’ little sachets release a chemical called 1-MCP, a potent plant hormone which sends a strong signal to fruits that it is not yet time to ripen. Producers simply need to toss a Hazel sachet into a box of their fruit. Over a three week period, that sachet releases a safe chemical that slows down the ripening process. Given that around [45% of all fruit grown is wasted](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2015/aug/12/produced-but-never-eaten-a-visual-guide-to-food-waste), technology that allows more time for produce to get to the market could have a huge impact, especially in the developing world.

There are tonnes of subscription services and business solving this problem in each city. (In Barcelona, Fruta Feia, amongst similar names in major cities)

- Cloud based software to predict shelf life
Since one-third of the world’s food goes to waste, [OneThird](https://onethird.io/) is aptly named. The company provides suppliers (including growers, retailers and distributors) with cloud-based software and handheld produce scanners to predict the shelf life of produce using AI. They also provide quality assessment to help suppliers make better decisions when it comes to reducing waste. 

The company prides itself in being highly accurate in its shelf life prediction (using data analysis and other techniques) to ensure products are delivered on time, from farm to fork. Suppliers can use their handheld scanners as well as AI-based quality-inspection cameras, and finally a data-sharing platform.

Neurolabs *https://www.neurolabs.eu/) r*educes food waste by accurately predicting demand with AI.** The Neurolabs team, based in Romania, are currently working on perfecting their algorithms and are planning to launch the product in Autumn 2019. Initial results indicate that they can [reduce supermarket waste by up to 40%](https://www.eu-startups.com/2019/03/romanian-startup-neurolabs-tech-is-helping-supermarkets-to-reduce-waste-by-up-to-40/).

- Apps that re-distribute food waste

# Household

-  [Olio](https://olioex.com/) is a platform which is trying to do just that. It’s a free app that connects neighbors with each other to flag and share surplus food. Users simply upload a photo and description, and then people in the neighborhood can claim the food before it goes to waste. They are now the biggest food-sharing network in the world with over 7 million users.
- Blue Apple (Bluapple) (http://thebluapple.com/) is a blue, apple-shaped product that sits in your refrigerator and absorbs ethylene gas, allowing consumers to store fresh produce for longer. It lasts for three months before it needs a refill, and is capable of extending produce shelf life by up to three times.
