Aside from being at home and/or being at restaurants, there is an  appeal for third spaces that were not traditionally where people ate but now people are spending time to eat. This also means culinary storytelling through innovative or non-traditional eating spaces (think eating while watching a theatre performance, etc)

## Consumer Demand Driving Innovation

The experiential dining trend is a bold response to changing consumer demands for experiences they cannot replicate at home[2](https://council.rollingstone.com/blog/the-rise-of-experiential-dining). Post-pandemic, diners increasingly seek out memorable, shareable experiences that justify leaving home and spending on dining out. This has pushed the food and hospitality industries to fuse creativity, technology, storytelling, and gastronomy in unprecedented ways.

Industry forecasts suggest that by 2026, experiential elements will be standard features in over 60% of mid-to-high-end dining establishments globally, compared to roughly 30% in 2023. The market for dining experiences categorized as "immersive" or "interactive" is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18% through 2028.

# Co-Living
Coliving environments present a particularly fascinating case study in how alternative housing models can transform food behaviors. Recent documentation from Anceu Coliving demonstrates how structured communal dining can become a central feature of the coliving experience. Their model implements "common dinners" five days per week, with residents divided into teams that rotate cooking responsibilities. Each participant contributes 20 euros weekly to cover all five dinners, creating an economically efficient system that distributes both the labor and cost of meal preparation[6](https://anceu.com/common-dinners-a-community-building-experience/).

This approach generates benefits beyond mere convenience. The Anceu system incorporates specific nutritional guidelines, including rotating protein sources daily (meat, fish, eggs, and soy-based options) and implementing zero-waste practices through "upcycling dinners" that creatively repurpose leftover ingredients[6](https://anceu.com/common-dinners-a-community-building-experience/). Such structured approaches to communal dining potentially address multiple challenges that individuals living independently might face, including food waste, dietary monotony, and the time constraints that often lead to less healthy food choices.

This example is in Galicia, Spain! https://anceu.com/rural-hackers-residencies-2/ so interesting!!!!

# Bookshop bars

For 2024, listening bars were earmarked as an emerging trend; this year, it’s the turn of bookshop bars — those establishments that operate somewhere between a bookshop, a cafe, a library and a bar. A decidedly analogue reaction against digital dominance, many ban laptops and wi-fi after 5pm, instead offering events, readings and happy hour drinks, from craft beers at Liz’s Book Bar in Brooklyn to the specialist riesling wine menu at Golden Sardine in San Francisco. The UK is cottoning on too, with the excellently named Gulp Fiction in Oxford; BookBar in Finsbury Park; and The Last Bookstore in Glasgow, which has small plates, a literary-themed cocktail menu and 8,000 books

# Interactive dining restaurants


Wild card - Japan has a restaurant that will help you to measure how you feel 

Inspired by the success of Tanita Corp's cookbook featuring healthy meals under 500 calories, the Tanita Shokudo restaurant offers patrons an interactive dining experience that gives them the tools to eat more healthily. In addition to timer that's set to 20 minutes (the optimal time it should take you to consume a meal, according to professional dieticians), each table has a weighing scale so that you can determine exactly how much you should eat for a healthy lunch or dinner. Further, there are professi onal dieticians at the restaurant to provide customers with free nutritional advice.
## Cannabis x Cuisine 

[Cannabis-infused cuisine](https://council.rollingstone.com/blog/cannabis-takes-over-the-culinary-scene) and drinks are emerging as a bold trend in experiential dining, offering guests a unique fusion of flavor, wellness, and creativity. These experiences often go beyond consumption, incorporating education and storytelling about the ingredients and their effects. Restaurants and pop-ups specializing in cannabis cuisine curate multi-course meals where each dish is paired with carefully measured cannabis infusions.  
  
Guests can explore a sensory journey, with chefs highlighting terpenes and cannabinoids that complement the meal's flavors and aromas. [Cannabis-infused cocktails](https://council.rollingstone.com/blog/the-rise-of-cannabis-infused-beverages) also join the menu, offering innovative, alcohol-free options that balance relaxation and indulgence. These elevated (literally) dining experiences cater to a growing audience interested in culinary artistry and cannabis culture, making them a perfect addition to experiential dining.
