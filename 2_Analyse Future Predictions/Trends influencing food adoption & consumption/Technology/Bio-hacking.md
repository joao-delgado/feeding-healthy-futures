Bio hacking has so many aspects to healthy foods - the most interesting bits to us is how metabolism, monitoring, gene editing technology (NAD+)

What is gene editing technologies: 

Advancements in gene editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-Cas9, have revolutionized the potential for biohacking at the genetic level. The precision and accessibility of these tools have improved dramatically, enabling more targeted modifications with fewer unintended consequences[3](https://antiagingbed.com/blogs/biohacking/the-future-of-biohacking-innovations-and-trends-to-watch). Future developments in this space are expected to make genetic editing techniques more accessible to biohackers, potentially allowing for the elimination of hereditary diseases or enhancement of specific physical and cognitive attributes[3](https://antiagingbed.com/blogs/biohacking/the-future-of-biohacking-innovations-and-trends-to-watch).




## Insights

[Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/new-artificial-intelligence-tool-cancer) developed an AI foundation model named CHIEF. This model has advanced the detection, prognosis and treatment prediction of multiple cancers. Data from Grand View Research indicates that the global personalized medicine market is expected to reach [$909.8 billion](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-personalized-medicine-market) by 2030, expanding at a CAGR of 8.2% from 2024 to 2030. As this technology becomes more accessible, it could disrupt traditional one-size-fits-all healthcare models.

The U.S. nootropic supplement market was valued at [$476.9 million](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/nootropic-supplements-market) in 2024 and is projected to experience a 7.9% CAGR through 2034. This growth is driven by increasing consumer awareness of brain health and cognitive enhancement. Research published by the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ demonstrated that [NAD+ supplementation](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1718819115) with nicotinamide riboside significantly improved learning, memory and motor functions in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model.

Harvard research indicates that adopting [five healthy habits](https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/healthy-longevity/)—maintaining a nutritious diet, engaging in regular physical activity, keeping a healthy body weight, not smoking and moderating alcohol intake—can help extend life expectancies. Companies like Levels and Nutrisense are leading the charge, offering personalized insights into how diet and lifestyle impact metabolic performance.

## Examples

**Advanced wearable tracking technologies**

The evolution of biohacking hardware has progressed from basic fitness trackers to sophisticated biomonitoring systems that provide unprecedented visibility into internal biological processes. Next-generation wearables now track previously inaccessible metrics including hydration levels, stress hormones, and even real-time neurotransmitter activity, creating comprehensive biological dashboards that guide optimization efforts[2](https://7am-aesthetica.com/blogs/future-trends/future-trends-in-biohacking-what-to-expect-by-2025). Devices such as non-invasive glucose monitors and continuous blood pressure trackers have moved from medical settings into everyday consumer use, enabling individuals to respond immediately to physiological changes rather than waiting for periodic medical checkups[2](https://7am-aesthetica.com/blogs/future-trends/future-trends-in-biohacking-what-to-expect-by-2025). The miniaturization of sensors and improvements in battery technology have made these devices less obtrusive and more practical for continuous use, reducing barriers to adoption and increasing compliance.

Smart wearables equipped with AI-powered analytics now offer more sophisticated insights than simple biometric tracking, including heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, sleep architecture mapping, and muscle oxygen saturation monitoring[4](https://www.jefit.com/wp/exercise-tips/top-biohacking-trends-enhance-health-athletic-performance/). Leading devices in this space such as WHOOP 5.0, Oura Ring Gen 4, and Garmin Enduro 2 provide real-time feedback on recovery status, training readiness, and potential overtraining risks[4](https://www.jefit.com/wp/exercise-tips/top-biohacking-trends-enhance-health-athletic-performance/). The integration of these systems with implantable technologies represents the frontier of biohacking hardware development. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) being developed by companies like Neuralink show promise for enhancing cognitive function and enabling direct communication between the human brain and external devices, potentially leading to significant improvements in memory, focus, and sensory processing[3](https://antiagingbed.com/blogs/biohacking/the-future-of-biohacking-innovations-and-trends-to-watch). This progression toward seamless integration between biological systems and technology signals a fundamental shift in how humans interact with and modify their own biology.
