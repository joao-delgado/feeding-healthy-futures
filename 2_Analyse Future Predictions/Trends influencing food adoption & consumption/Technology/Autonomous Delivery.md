# Autonomous Delivery and Virtual Brands

Restaurant Trends, [LS Retail ](https://www.lsretail.com/resources/restaurant-trends-predictions)
> Food delivery remains a driving force in the restaurant industry, but 2025 promises to revolutionize how it’s done. Autonomous delivery vehicles, drones, and sidewalk robots are becoming more prevalent, slashing costs and speeding up service. Companies like Uber have already been testing self-driving cars for food delivery, while others, like American fast-food enterprise Wendy’s, are exploring drones capable of delivering orders in record time.
> At the same time, virtual brands—restaurants operating exclusively online—are thriving, thanks to their flexibility and adaptability. By leveraging ghost kitchens, these brands can focus on creating highly personalized menus designed to meet specific dietary preferences or regional tastes. Enhanced AI and data analytics are helping these businesses stay ahead of consumer cravings, fine-tune offerings, and adapt quickly to new trends. Together, these innovations are setting the stage for a faster and more customer-centric food delivery system.

> Food Delivery Robots Are Open For Work, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gustavo-castillo/2024/12/31/food-delivery-robots-are-openforwork/) 
A morning stroll in Los Angeles has all the views one might expect: sunshine, palm trees, fitness influencers, and increasingly, bug eyed robots barreling down the sidewalk delivering breakfast burritos. Delivery robots have steadily grown in number over the years and Los Angeles has become a hub for their use.

> Serve Robotics operates a delivery program in Los Angeles. The publicly traded company has a partnership with Uber Eats and announced they are planning to deploy up to [2,000 robots in multiple markets](https://www.serverobotics.com/uber-scaling "https://www.serverobotics.com/uber-scaling"). Coco, who counts Sam Altman, current CEO of OpenAI, as one of its early backers, has conducted over 400k deliveries with hundreds of merchants in multiple markets. Starship, not to be confused with SpaceX’s rocket, has completed over 8 million deliveries in 100 different service areas including cities, campuses, and industrial sites.

> Starship Technology’s robot operates at a maximum speed of 6km/h (~3.7 mph) or roughly walking speed. Even a 2 mile delivery could take over 30 minutes to arrive at a customer’s home. While in theory delivery robots could complete longer deliveries, customers may not be willing to wait so long to get their food and long transit times would mean cold meals when the robot arrives.

> SINGAPORE – Workers in South Beach’s office tower can now get purchases such as ready-to-eat meals, drinks and snacks from a nearby 7-Eleven store delivered directly to them by a robot.

Autonomous Retail Store, 
QuikBot’s collaborator, 7-Eleven, also has a milestone to show off. Shop & Go is 7-Eleven’s first autonomous retail store. It’s the same store we all know, except the cashier is conspicuously absent. You simply tap your credit or debit card, take any item you want (or put it back when you don’t) and walk out.
