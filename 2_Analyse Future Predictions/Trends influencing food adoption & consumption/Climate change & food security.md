# Climate change effects on supply chain

Research indicates that approximately 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with the food system, creating an urgent imperative for transformation[6](https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2023-05/Eating_For_Net_Zero_Full_Report.pdf). The environmental impact of various food categories varies dramatically, with animal products generating disproportionate emissions. European food-associated greenhouse gas emissions are attributed 50% to meat and dairy consumption alone, with beef, lamb, pork, and cheese generating 3-13 times more emissions than vegetables and legumes per unit weight[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3556605/).

# Collaborative Food Production and Distribution
(Think cooperative, shared food banks, etc)

Over the next decade, community-led food initiatives will evolve from niche projects to mainstream approaches for strengthening social resilience and addressing sustainability challenges. Urban gardens, farmers' cooperatives, and local food markets will expand significantly, creating new social infrastructures centered around collaborative food production and distribution. These initiatives will transform how urban communities interact, turning food production from an industrial process removed from daily life into a community activity that builds relationships while addressing practical needs[5](https://impacthub.net/world-food-day-why-food-systems-matter/).

The social impact of these collaborative food systems extends beyond mere production efficiency to create robust community networks that can withstand external disruptions like supply chain failures or economic downturns. Participation in community-supported agriculture programs, neighborhood gardens, and food-sharing networks will create regular touchpoints for social interaction across demographic boundaries, bringing together diverse community members around shared interests in food quality, accessibility, and sustainability. These systems will particularly empower marginalized communities by creating local economic opportunities and addressing food access inequities through collaborative rather than charitable models[5](https://impacthub.net/world-food-day-why-food-systems-matter/).
# institutional Frameworks and Policy Evolution

International organizations have established ambitious roadmaps explicitly connecting climate actions with nutrition goals. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has developed a comprehensive roadmap outlining sequential targets: by 2030, chronic hunger should be eliminated, and by 2035, the number of people without access to healthy diets should be cut by half compared to 2020 levels[1](https://www.fao.org/interactive/sdg2-roadmap/assets/3d-models/inbrief-roadmap.pdf). Parallel climate targets establish that by 2035, agrifood systems should achieve carbon dioxide neutrality (with only other greenhouse gases remaining as net emitters)[1](https://www.fao.org/interactive/sdg2-roadmap/assets/3d-models/inbrief-roadmap.pdf). This institutional alignment between climate and nutrition objectives represents a significant evolution in policy frameworks.

The THRIVING Food Futures project, established in early 2025, exemplifies the institutional response linking climate action with dietary health. Led by Oxford's Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, this initiative explicitly aims to help the United Kingdom meet its legally mandated Net Zero targets through enabling sustainable diets[7](https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2025/march/thriving-sustainable-diets). The project acknowledges that without significant dietary change, the UK cannot meet its climate commitments. The research hub's focus on designing and evaluating food policies highlights the growing recognition that climate-friendly diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and cereals while low in red and processed meat simultaneously address public health challenges including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer[7](https://www.citystgeorges.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2025/march/thriving-sustainable-diets).

Government policies increasingly implement "double-duty" or "triple-duty" actions targeting both climate change and health outcomes simultaneously. Research has identified taxes on less healthy, less sustainable foods as one example of a policy approach addressing both obesity/non-communicable diseases and climate change simultaneously[5](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Burgaz,%20et%20al._Good%20Practice%20Government%20Policies%20on%20Food%20Systems%20to%20Simultaneously%20Address%20Undernutrition,%20Obesity%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf). This policy integration represents a significant shift from siloed approaches toward systems thinking that recognizes the interconnectedness of climate, health, and food systems. However, analysis also reveals potential trade-offs, with some policies addressing undernutrition potentially increasing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, packaging, or food waste[5](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Burgaz,%20et%20al._Good%20Practice%20Government%20Policies%20on%20Food%20Systems%20to%20Simultaneously%20Address%20Undernutrition,%20Obesity%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf). These complex intersections require careful policy design through 2035.

## Insights

EIT Food community has identified that food security solutions are becoming increasingly localized in response to climate events, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain disruptions[2](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/top-5-food-trends-in-2024). This shift manifests through growing investment in community-based projects, urban agriculture solutions, and shortened supply chains that increase resilience while often emphasizing fresh, minimally processed foods.

The localization trend intersects with growing recognition of indigenous food systems and traditional ecological knowledge. Greater acknowledgment of the relationship between nature, Indigenous Peoples, and sustainable food production is emerging as a significant trend that will likely strengthen through 2035[2](https://www.eitfood.eu/blog/top-5-food-trends-in-2024). This includes renewed interest in heritage crops, traditional preservation methods, and cultural food practices that typically emphasize whole, unprocessed ingredients. The revival of these knowledge systems represents both a return to historical wisdom and an innovation pathway for creating resilient, place-based food systems.

## Examples


The Melting Pot Foundation's Manq'a initiative exemplifies this trend through restaurant-schools offering culinary training to youth in underserved communities across Latin America. This model creates a powerful ripple effect by simultaneously preserving cultural food traditions, creating employment opportunities, and fostering community pride. Over the next decade, this integration of education with gastronomy will become more commonplace, with food businesses explicitly designed to address specific community needs while providing high-quality culinary experiences. These multi-purpose food ventures will create entirely new social spaces that blend commercial dining with community development, making social impact an integral part of the food experience rather than a separate charitable activity[3](https://hospitalityinsights.ehl.edu/how-innovative-business-models-gastronomy-lead-social-impact).
