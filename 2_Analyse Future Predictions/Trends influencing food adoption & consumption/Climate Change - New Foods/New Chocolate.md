# Chocolate is not forever

[[Coffee - Kahve or Qahwa]] 

The climate crisis drove weeks of high temperatures in the west African region responsible for about 70% of global cacao production, hitting harvests and probably causing further record chocolate prices, researchers have said.

Farmers in the region have struggled with heat, disease and unusual rainfall in recent years, which have contributed to falling production.


It’s already been predicted that there will be a higher deficit in cocoa production this year, with global production projected to [decline by -14.2%](https://www.icco.org/august-2024-quarterly-bulletin-of-cocoa-statistics/) or 4.332 million tonnes, according to the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).

Below road map of cacao alternatives:

# Eat Win Win

(Supposedly the first? that broke into the non-cacao market) - The key difference is that we start with hero ingredients that are not cocoa beans. By using these types of raw materials, we’ve been able to significantly reduce carbon emissions: by 80% compared to conventional chocolate production. And, because we use cereals and legumes that don’t require as much water as cocoa, which is an incredibly water-intensive crop, our production requires 90% less water than chocolate too.

## Harnessing the fava bean

Take the case of Nukoko, for example, a UK-based startup producing cocoa-free chocolates using fermentation technology. The founders developed a way to create key chocolate flavour compounds from the fava bean, an abundant and cost-effective raw material typically grown in temperate regions. This bean is also commonly used as a rotational crop in agriculture, enabling better soil health and reducing the need for fertilizers. Supported by agri-food focused venture investors such as The Mills Fabrica, Nukoko is scaling its manufacturing process to create impact at an industrial scale, selling to food and beverage manufacturers worldwide.

# Upcycled Sugar

The Supplant Company, a foodtech that turns agricultural side streams like corn cobs, husks and shells into ingredients like sugar alternatives and flour that, used effectively, can [increase](https://bit.ly/3XzmbB0) global sugar and flour production. The Supplant Company’s blend of sugars made from agricultural side-streams not only tastes like sugar, but is lower in calories, prebiotic, low-glycemic and gluten-free. This upcycled sugar is being used to manufacture chocolate bars that replace cane sugar for a more innovative, sustainable and healthier option.

# Chocoviva - fermentation of oats & sunflower seeds

The company’s fermentation process uses proprietary technologies to turn all-natural, locally-sourced ingredients - including oats and sunflower seeds - into ChoViva: a cocoa mass and cocoa butter with melt-in-the-mouth texture and full-bodied chocolate flavour. The product can be used in hybrid context with conventional chocolate, or as a full replacer. It contains up to 30% less sugar, and has a very low CO2 footprint due to local ingredients and short supply chains.

# Lab made chocolate

- California Cultured: The company extracts cacao cells and places them in fermentation tanks. They get nourished, begin replicating and harvesting begins within four days. The company then takes the harvested cells and puts them through the fermentation, drying and roasting techniques common among traditional chocolate manufacturers.
    

- Celleste Bio: As with California Cultured, cultured cacao cells serve as the foundation for Celleste Bio’s alternative chocolate products. The company extracts cells from a single cocoa bean and then grows them in bioreactors, where they feast on nutrients including sugar, vitamins and water. The Celleste Bio approach incorporates biotechnology, ag-tech and artificial intelligence in its product development, which allows for custom tweaking of its cocoa products to adjust things attributes such as bitterness and melting points.

- Kokomodo: This Israeli startup turns to cellular agriculture technology to grow cacao, without growing and harvesting the plants in the tropics. Instead, the company grows cacao in labs.
