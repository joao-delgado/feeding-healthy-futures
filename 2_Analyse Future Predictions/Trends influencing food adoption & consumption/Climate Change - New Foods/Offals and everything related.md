Meat consumption is less planet friendly, but what if we ate the meat from head to tail, instead of cherry-picking which meats and which part of the meat?
## Sustainable offal

Another speaker at Chefs Revolution was the young Viennese chef Lukas Mraz, from the two-star restaurant Mraz & Sohn**, which he runs with his father and brother. On stage, Mraz emphasized how we only eat a few parts of an animal, and just the most well known pieces at that. A shame, according to him, because there is so much more meat that is available, and is just as tasty.

# Horse's head as an appetizer

During the two-day Chefs Revolution festival, organized by Jonnie and Thérèse Boer of the three star Dutch restaurant Librije***, top international chefs came together in Zwolle, the Netherlands. One of the speakers was Max Stiegl, an Austrian chef with Slovenian roots who is an outspoken advocate of the head-to-tail philosophy.
