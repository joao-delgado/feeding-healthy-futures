# Beanless coffee

Rising coffee consumption in tea-drinking countries such as India and China, considering the climate, the demand for coffee is of concern. Three start-ups with very different production methods treat us to a beanless cup of joe. The Dutch Northern Wonder, San Francisco-based Minus Coffee and Singapore-based Another Food are all determined to eliminate the coffee bean to reduce rainforest deforestation and water use.

### Coffee-without-coffee producers

- **Northern Wonder's** Dutch David Klingen is betting on a lupine- and chickpea-based coffee alternative. The company already has their products in supermarkets and sells to consumers at home and abroad.
    
- Maricel of Minus of San Francisco-based **Minus Coffee** pours a cold-brew with a deep coffee and mocha flavor that drinks away pleasantly. The drink is made by toasting, grinding and then fermenting upcycled kernels, roots and seeds.
    
- Stéphane Chen of Singapore-based **Another Food** reproduces the natural growth of coffee cells by cultivating them in her laboratory, by using cell-based production method that conserves the rainforest. This start-up is still in its early stages but the products look promising.
