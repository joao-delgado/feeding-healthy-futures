# Blurred lines between food & functional wellness 

[[Global Foods]] [[Global Supply Chain |Globalization]]

The psychological dimension of food consumption has catalyzed growing interest in mood-supporting ingredients. Botanicals—including herbs, flowers, and roots—are increasingly incorporated into teas, seltzers, and various food products[1](https://foodinsight.org/food-trends-2024/). Specifically, ingredients like ashwagandha and turmeric, traditionally associated with stress reduction and anti-inflammatory benefits, have gained prominence in the wellness-focused food product landscape[1](https://foodinsight.org/food-trends-2024/). This trend suggests that by 2035, the distinction between food and functional wellness products may become increasingly blurred, with consumers expecting nutritional and psychological benefits from their everyday diet.

 # Function focused hydration / Water isn't just water

In 2023 we saw a boom in flavored sparkling water (#WaterTok garnered over 960 million mentions on TikTok!) and the premium hydration category was launched into the zeitgeist,” explains Jenny Phillips, IFIC’s Senior Manager of Communications.

E.g Brain Water’s (US) sugar-free electrolyte blend is designed for specific occasions, from studying to hangovers. It boosts hydration to aid cognitive function or mood regulation 

 ## Move over Wine  
 
 At the same time, González points to a growing appetite for non-alcoholic beverages. “While people are getting more adventurous with wines, there’s an increase in the number of people who are looking for a healthier approach,” he explains. “Having a good non-alcoholic programme should be part of our plan in the industry—not mocktails but something more complex, such as fermented drinks, teas, homemade carbonated sodas, juices and the like.”

# Protein packed carbs

Keep an eye out for products fortified with protein, such as rice, pasta, baking mixes, nut protein powders, and snack foods. This is not surprising, since “high-protein” was the number one ranked eating pattern from the IFIC 2023 _Food & Health Survey_ (at 18%, followed by mindful eating [17%], calorie-counting [12%], clean eating [12%], and intermittent fasting [12%]).
# Ageing population

Ageing populations, coupled with rising concern over the prevalence of diet-related health issues, have created a growing adoption of eating patterns that support consumers’ long-term health. More consumers are now looking at food as medicine [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] / [[Ayurveda]] focusing on diet and nutrition’s role in the prevention of health conditions. The longevity dieting trends focus on developing foods and eating patterns that not only support an extended lifespan but also enhance the quality of life by emphasising the protective role of diet on health.
