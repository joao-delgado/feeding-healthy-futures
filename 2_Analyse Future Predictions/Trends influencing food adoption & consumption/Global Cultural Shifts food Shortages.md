# Global Food Shortages and Price Increases 

The Sad Future of Grocery Shopping, [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/07/golden-age-supermarket-food-shortages/678970/)
> Climate change is also worsening the conditions that allow pests and disease to thrive. Along with heat- and water-related stress, “it’s very clear, globally, that both are becoming more common,” David Lobell, a professor and the director of Stanford University’s Center on Food Security and the Environment, told me. Over the past two decades, Florida’s orange and grapefruit production has plummeted [more than 75 percent](https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2023/12/19/ucr-wages-11-million-war-against-citrus-greening-disease) because of citrus greening, an infection spread by tiny bugs that is now [also ravaging fruit in Brazil](https://www.fruitnet.com/eurofruit/disease-and-climate-change-slash-brazils-orange-output/260342.article). Other impacts of climate change on agriculture are less visible. It has [dried up fields of grass](https://extension.okstate.edu/articles/2023/cattle-drought.html), which farmers rely on to feed their cows. Last year, [beef prices hit a near-record high](https://www.agriculturedive.com/news/cattle-supply-drought-near-record-beef-prices/653239/?ref=ambrook).

>  For basic commodity crops such as cocoa, wheat, and coffee, price increases may seem minor compared with what’s happening on farms themselves; these goods are typically stockpiled, which means there’s usually a backup supply to draw from if there’s a shortage, softening any upticks in price. The sheer range of products available allows most shortages to be sidestepped painlessly: Shoppers can swap olive oil for canola; juice makers can substitute mandarins for oranges. Food companies also have tricks so that you don’t notice food shortages. In March, Cadbury confirmed that it had [downsized one of its chocolate bars](https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/cadbury-fans-outraged-over-last-32436391) because [cocoa has become more expensive](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/04/cocoa-shortage-chocolate-expensive/678053/) thanks to poor harvests.

## Insights

**Perplexity: Global Food Security Crisis: Current and Projected Crop Shortages Through 2030**

Current and Projected Global Crop Shortages
A groundbreaking study published in Environmental Research Letters projects that by 2030, the probability of crop failures across global breadbaskets will be 4.5 times higher than current levels, and could become an alarming 25 times more likely by 2050[4](https://www.theenergymix.com/crop-failures-nearly-5-times-more-likely-by-2030/). Four staple crops—wheat, maize, rice, and soybeans—constitute approximately two-thirds of global food calories, with 72% of their production concentrated in just five countries: China, the United States, India, Brazil, and Argentina[4](https://www.theenergymix.com/crop-failures-nearly-5-times-more-likely-by-2030/).

The outlook becomes increasingly dire beyond 2030, with rice and maize failures projected to occur at least every other year by 2050 in global breadbasket regions—events currently considered "extremely unlikely"[4](https://www.theenergymix.com/crop-failures-nearly-5-times-more-likely-by-2030/). The situation for soybeans appears even more precarious, with an 81% chance of crop failure occurring in any given year by mid-century[4](https://www.theenergymix.com/crop-failures-nearly-5-times-more-likely-by-2030/).

Primary Drivers of Global Crop Shortages
## Climate Change Impacts
Climate change represents perhaps the most pervasive and intensifying threat to global food security. As noted by an international team of researchers in a paper published by Trends in Plant Science, crops worldwide are increasingly struggling to survive extreme weather events, from heat waves to droughts and floods[1](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/climate-change-threatens-global-food-supply-scientists-call-urgent-action). These climate-related challenges not only reduce crop survival rates but can also diminish the nutritional value of harvests[1](https://www.preventionweb.net/news/climate-change-threatens-global-food-supply-scientists-call-urgent-action).

## Energy and Fertilizer Crisis

The global energy crisis of 2021-2023 has had cascading effects on food production through its impact on fertilizer markets. Natural gas serves as a major feedstock for ammonia production via the Haber process, which is essential for fertilizer manufacturing[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises). Record-high fertilizer prices have severely strained agricultural systems worldwide, with industry experts warning that "50% of the world's food relies on fertilizers"[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises).

## Supply Chain Disruptions
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted global food supply chains, affecting distribution channels at both consumption and distribution stages[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises). These disruptions were compounded by rising fuel and transportation costs, which increased the complexity and expense of food distribution worldwide[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises).

## Geopolitical Conflicts

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 highlighted how geopolitical conflicts can severely impact global food security. Prior to the invasion, Ukraine was the fourth-largest exporter of corn and wheat, and together with Russia, responsible for 27% of global wheat exports and 53% of sunflower and seed exports[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises). The conflict crippled these supplies, resulting in inflation and scarcity in dependent countries[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932023_global_food_crises).

## Population Growth and Land Competition

Growing global populations are increasing demand for food at the same time that available agricultural land is shrinking due to urbanization and other competing uses. In the UK alone, population growth, housing expansion, and the development of bioenergy crops are projected to require an additional seven million hectares of land by 2030[3](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-28003435).

> **White bread: Up 59% since 2019** (War)
The price of wheat has since cratered, but the Russian war gave producers an excuse to increase prices. For years, bakeries really needed the price of bread to go up to cover their labor, energy, and transportation costs, and finally, they had the opportunity. “Once the dam broke, it was going to be quite awhile for the inflation to go back down,” Swanson says.

> **Processed cheese: Up 25% since 2019.** (Probably due to US Subsidy Programs that)
> In 2022, the price of milk was too low for farmers to make money. When cheese prices skyrocketed in 2022, retailers couldn’t raise prices that much, Swanson says. So when cheese prices fell back down, retailers tried to recover what they had lost. The price of processed cheese is still 25% above what it was in January 2019.

> **Ground beef: Up 32% since 2019** (Water Shortage)
> In the beginning of 2024, there were only 87.2 million cattle and calves in the United States. That may seem like a lot of cows—roughly one for every four people in the U.S., but that number actually represents the lowest inventory since 1951. Fewer cows means higher prices for the ones that are getting sold and turned into meat. U.S. herds are at such low levels primarily because of drought and high supply costs.

> **Potatoes: Up 30% from 2019** (Drought and Wild Fires)
> Potato crops in 2021 and 2022 were severely affected by drought and wildfire smoke, reducing yields. With fewer potatoes in the U.S. and abroad, prices jumped. In 2023, though, U.S. potato production increased for the first time in seven years, which should temper prices.>)
> 
>  **Romaine Lettuce: Up 19% from 2019** (Disease) 
>  An insect-born virus destroyed huge swaths of lettuce crops in California in 2022, causing costs to spike. The price has fallen since then, but labor and transportation costs are still higher than in 2019, which means suppliers aren’t rushing to bring down prices further.
