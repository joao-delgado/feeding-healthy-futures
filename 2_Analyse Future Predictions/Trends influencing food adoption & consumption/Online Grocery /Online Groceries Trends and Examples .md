# Online Grocery Stores 

> [!note] > Diogo's comment
> Interesting note!
> 
> Besides the fact that this note clearly illustrates a shift in consumer buying behavior, I appreciate how you connect it with other notes we have.
> 
> My only suggestion is that it would be interesting to include some data on the sales of sustainable and ethical food products. It's one thing for consumers to say these attributes are important to them, but it's another to see if they are actually willing to pay more for them.
> 
> Last but not least—and this is something for us to consider—can’t we connect the increase in online grocery sales and the use of AI in the shopping journey with the growing disconnection between us and the food we eat?


Future of Food: Top Online Grocery Trends, [NIQ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/online-grocery-trends/)
- The Rise of Subscriptions
	- One of the most significant trends is the continued growth of subscription services. These services, which offer convenience through recurring deliveries of essential items, are becoming increasingly popular among busy households. Subscription models allow consumers to automate their grocery shopping, ensuring they never run out of staples like milk, eggs, or pantry items. They’re also a good way for consumers to save money, and with consumers are spending **33%** more in the past 4+ years, many are seeking out ways to save.3
	- Additionally, these services often offer [personalized recommendations](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2024/is-incomplete-product-content-restricting-personalized-shopping-journeys/) based on previous purchases, making the shopping experience more tailored and efficient. As more consumers embrace this convenient way of shopping, retailers are expanding their subscription offerings to include meal kits, specialty products, and even wellness-focused items, further embedding themselves into the daily lives of their customers.

> - Consumer Demand for Sustainability and Ethics
> 	- With growing awareness of environmental issues, consumers are increasingly seeking out products that align with their values. This includes choosing items with [eco-friendly packaging](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/education/2024/good-things-come-from-sustainable-packaging-how-to-get-ready-for-epr/), supporting brands with transparent and ethical supply chains, and opting for local or organic produce. In fact, **69% of consumers** state that sustainability is more important to them than it was two years ago, so many brands are capitalizing on this opportunity.

- Continued Health and Wellness Growth
	- According to NIQ’s 2023 Consumer Outlook, **46% of consumers** identified physical or mental wellness as one of their top priorities.5 As consumers become more [health-conscious](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/report/2024/tasting-tomorrow-dive-into-the-trends-shaping-food-and-beverage-in-2024/), there is a growing demand for online grocery options that cater to specific dietary needs and preferences. Whether it’s organic produce, gluten-free snacks, or plant-based alternatives, consumers are looking for products that support their health goals.

	- Challenges 
		- Customer Satisfaction, Inventory Management and Perishability
			- The rapid growth of the online grocery market has brought with it significant logistical and supply chain challenges. As demand for online grocery shopping continues to rise, retailers face the complex task of efficiently managing inventory, ensuring product availability, and meeting delivery expectations. The perishability of many grocery items adds an additional layer of complexity, requiring robust cold chain logistics to maintain product quality from the warehouse to the consumer’s doorstep. Delays, inventory shortages, and the inability to maintain product freshness can lead to customer dissatisfaction and lost sales. Moreover, the surge in demand for delivery services has strained last-mile logistics, making it difficult for retailers to keep pace with consumer expectations for fast and reliable delivery.
	- Future Advancement through AI and Autonomous Delivery 
		- The future of online grocery shopping is poised to be shaped by significant technological innovations that promise to enhance the consumer experience and streamline operations. Advances in [artificial intelligence](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/commentary/2023/artificial-intelligence-for-all-great-ai-for-some-quality-predictive-modeling-and-analysis-demand-best-in-class-data/) (AI) and machine learning are expected to play a crucial role in personalizing the shopping journey, with AI-driven algorithms providing tailored product recommendations and optimizing inventory management. In fact, a recent study from Honeywell reports **[97% of retailers](https://sps.honeywell.com/us/en/campaigns/productivity/discover-frictionless-retail)** surveyed claim to be using AI technologies – or are in active discussions to use them – for select use cases or regions, on a large scale, or in a pilot phase.  Moreover, the adoption of autonomous delivery vehicles and drones could revolutionize last-mile logistics, making deliveries faster and more efficient while reducing operational costs. As these technologies continue to evolve, they will not only improve convenience for shoppers but also help retailers meet the growing demand for speed and personalization

[the Hungry Root Kitchen Review ](https://www.thekitchn.com/hungryroot-review-22981315)
> What You Should Know About Getting Started with Hungryroot
> First, new shoppers will start their journey by completing the Hungryroot quiz to help determine their taste and preferences (like gluten-free, low-carb, vegan eaters, and even down to the types of cuisines you like). With questions like “What are your goals?” (I chose “waste less food” and “try new things”), “What are your nutrition preferences?” (where you can choose from immune-boosting, gut-friendly, carb-conscious, and even anti-inflammatory options), and “How many snacks do you want each week?” (a very important question, TBH) it has all the fun of a Buzzfeed quiz. 
> From there, you can browse through the selections, which are split between two categories: recipes (the meal kits) and groceries (standalone items, like pantry staples, snacks, breakfast-friendly items, and more).
