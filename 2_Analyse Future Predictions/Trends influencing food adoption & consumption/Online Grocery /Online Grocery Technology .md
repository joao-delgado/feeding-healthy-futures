**Perplexity Question** 
With online shopping becoming more commonplace, what are some of the ways retailers are marketing to consumers online? Please pay particular attention to online grocery or food purchases. Tactics may involve, influencers, social media, data partnerships, data extractions, price manipulation, sales, etc

### Data-Driven Marketing Strategies
The digital marketplace has enabled grocery retailers to gather and leverage vast amounts of consumer data, transforming how they approach marketing. Comprehensive grocery data capture through supermarket web scraping services provides retailers with detailed information on prices, inventory, and product details from across the market[4](https://www.actowizsolutions.com/grocery-delivery-data-scraping.php). This automated data extraction delivers accurate, timely insights that can inform strategic decision-making and competitive positioning.

### Price Strategies and Manipulation Techniques
Online retailers, including grocery stores, employ various pricing strategies to influence consumer purchasing decisions, some of which border on manipulation. Research published in Marketing Science revealed a practice called "price-increase and list-price synchronization" (PILPS), where retailers simultaneously increase an item's price while displaying a discount claim[5](https://thunderbird.asu.edu/thought-leadership/insights/buyer-beware-how-online-retailers-manipulate-prices-and-what-consumers). This tactic creates the illusion of a bargain while actually charging customers more than they would have paid previously. The research found numerous examples where retailers raised an item's price and simultaneously introduced a "list price" to create the appearance of a discount when customers were actually paying significantly more[5](https://thunderbird.asu.edu/thought-leadership/insights/buyer-beware-how-online-retailers-manipulate-prices-and-what-consumers).

### Customer Engagement and Retention Tactics
To make loyalty programs more engaging, many grocery retailers are gamifying the points system or offering additional incentives for product subscriptions[1](https://noahdigital.ca/blog/grocery-store-marketing-strategies-that-work-to-grow-and-profit-online/). VIP tiers with perks like free delivery or priority shipping further encourage customer loyalty while differentiating the shopping experience based on customer value.
Push notifications through grocery apps serve as digital nudges that prompt customers to complete purchases or take advantage of limited-time offers[6](https://www.geekschip.com/blog/grocery-store-sales). When used strategically and sparingly, these notifications can effectively bring customers back to abandoned carts or alert them to personalized deals based on their shopping history. Similarly, QR codes and chatbots enhance the shopping experience by providing instant access to product information, recipes, or customer service assistance[6](https://www.geekschip.com/blog/grocery-store-sales). These technologies bridge the information gap that sometimes exists in online shopping compared to in-store experiences where customers can ask staff for recommendations or advice.

### Influencers 
Influencer marketing has transformed how grocery brands connect with consumers by leveraging trusted voices to promote products through authentic, engaging content. This approach involves partnering with food bloggers, chefs, and social media creators who have established credibility and engagement with audiences interested in food products, recipes, or dining experiences[3](https://www.firework.com/blog/influencer-marketing-in-the-grocery-industry).
Several major food brands have successfully implemented influencer marketing strategies. HelloFresh collaborates with lifestyle influencers and [YouTubers](https://www.youtube.com/@HelloFreshUS/videos) who create detailed meal preparation videos using their kits, showcasing the convenience and quality of their products. Chipotle engages with influencers on TikTok through creative challenges like the [ChipotleLidFlip, ](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/chipotlelidflip)encouraging followers to participate and generate viral content.

## Insights

**Price manipulation** 
With the increase of data collection available to companies, they can use this to manipulate pricing online. Amazon has already gained 

What is Amazon's secret pricing strategy and what is the FTC lawsuit alleging cost manipulation tactics?, [Economic Times ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/what-is-amazons-secret-pricing-strategy-and-what-is-the-ftc-lawsuit-alleging-cost-manipulation-tactics/articleshow/104966949.cms?from=mdr)
> Synopsis: In the ongoing Federal Trade Commission (FTC) legal battle against Amazon over alleged antitrust violations, a surprising revelation has come to light. Newly disclosed court documents reveal that Amazon had a hidden strategy to artificially raise prices, resulting in over $1 billion being collected from American households.
> In 2018, Amazon employed Project Nessie to set prices for products viewed by consumers over 400 million times. In April 2018 alone, this tool was responsible for pricing on more than 8 million items, collectively costing nearly $194 million. Notably, Project Nessie focused on increasing prices for products that were already generating substantial profits. Its sole purpose was to boost consumer prices by influencing other online stores to raise their prices.  


**Artificial Intelligence Surveillance** 
The ability of artificial intelligence to track your movements to influence your purchases

Artificial Intelligence Is Already Taking Over Grocery Stores, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2023/09/27/artificial-intelligence-isnt-coming-to-supermarkets-its-there/)
> An Israeli company called ShopperAI, also exhibiting at Groceryshop, trained its AI on video of the supermarket snack aisle. It found many consumers stopped, looked, picked up the multipacks, put them back, and walked away. The process recommended rearranging the shelf so that all brands’ multipacks were together in one place. That didn’t just increase multipack sales, it led to an 18% increase in packaged snack revenue overall.
>
> It also looked at the shampoo shelf. It saw that only 30% of the consumers who shopped the aisle were women; to draw more, it recommended putting the feminine hygiene products next to the shampoo. When that happened, women shoppers came to the aisle, and shampoo sales grew by 25%.
> 
> The next step is personalizing grocery shopping and, “generative AI makes this personalization possible,” Lori Schafer, CEO of Digital Wave Technology, told me. Things like individualized weekly recipes and personalized pre-assembled shopping baskets or guiding a consumer in-store to find the products become possible.
> 
> A company called Birdzi is already personalizing grocery marketing. “If a consumer buys kettle corn, ice cream and kale but doesn’t buy paper goods or other stuff, we generate offers to get them into the store and spend on other things,” Shekar Raman, CEO and co-founder of Birdzi, told me. The emails are so effective they are opened at a rate that is about 10 times greater than most marketing emails and Birdzi will send 300 million of them just this year and probably a billion next year.
