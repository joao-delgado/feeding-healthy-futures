> [!note] > Diogo's comment
> The numbers are really impressive! 
> 
> In my opinion, we should complement this note with a few examples of alternatives to online shopping:
> - [Instacart](https://www.instacart.com/)
> - [Amazon Fresh](https://www.amazon.com/fmc/storefront?almBrandId=QW1hem9uIEZyZXNo)
> - [Uber Eats](https://www.ubereats.com/pt)
> - [Walmart grocery](https://www.walmart.com/cp/food/976759)
>  
> Another aspect that could be interesting to explore is the connection between the increase in online food sales and the disconnection with what we eat. For what we have been talking about, the fact that nowadays more and more people buy food online could be one of the reasons for this disconnection.
