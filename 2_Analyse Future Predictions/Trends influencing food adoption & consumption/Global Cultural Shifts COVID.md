> [!note] > Diogo's comment
> In my opinion, this topic is essential to our research. I believe you should explore it further.
> 
> As the data in this note shows, the world changed during COVID. Not only did our habits shift, but our health and life expectancy were also affected.
> 
> A study by the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/news-events/newsroom/news-releases/covid-19-had-greater-impact-life-expectancy-previously-known) (IHME) highlights that life expectancy declined in 84% of countries and territories, with regions such as Mexico City, Peru, and Bolivia experiencing some of the most significant reductions.

The charts below are from the NY Times, documenting 2015 - 2025 and are based on Americans. Trying to identify the influence of COVID, since it has now been 5 years. 

These are the most significant charts that can identify trends in consumption patterns. 
- **Groceries vs Restaurants** (LO: Look into what kind segments of restaurants are people eating at?)
- **Alcohol Sales** 
- **Online Shopping**
- **Time Spent at Home** 
- **Socialization**

**(How much does staying home to work or be at leisure inform how much people cook? and do they get better at cooking or are they using delivery apps?)**

**Socialization**
There has been a significant decrease in socialization since the pandemic

(Has dating or dating apps affected the way we adopt healthy food?)
Has technology (social media, instant messaging apps, dating apps) shaped the way we eat? Have relationships with people online? 
What about online streaming food content like Mukbang or social feed influencers cooking - what does it to our brains of how we eat/choose food? 
(Taahira: I believe i watch more food being made than i do eat it myself)
