> Both the term “regenerative agriculture” and the practices that define it are not modern creations. As mentioned above, it is imperative to always note that regenerative agriculture practices draw from Indigenous wisdom and practices.

> A new coalition of food and wellness companies is looking to redefine business ethics in the Trump era. Called The Purpose Pledge, these companies are creating a community of practice based on economic fairness, environmental sustainability, and independent governance. As major food and beverage conglomerates are [beating a hasty retreat](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/03/01/state-street-drops-corporate-board-diversity-requirement-here-are-all-the-companies-cutting-dei-programs/) from their previous [ESG, sustainability](https://www.esgdive.com/news/esg-outlook-ai-climate-alliances-2025/738852/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Issue:%202025-02-05%20ESG%20Dive%20%5Bissue:70168%5D&utm_term=ESG%20Dive) , and [DEI commitments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2025/03/01/state-street-drops-corporate-board-diversity-requirement-here-are-all-the-companies-cutting-dei-programs/), [The Purpose Pledge](https://go.lifteconomy.com/blog/purpose-pledge-b-corp-setting-the-record-straight) is pointing a new way forward.

## [Real Organic ](https://realorganicproject.org/)
> USDA Organic has Lost its Way 
> We refuse to let Big Ag define what it means to be 'organic'. We grow food in the soil, not hydroponically. We raise livestock on pasture, not in confinement. As we lose trust in the USDA, Real Organic remains exactly what organic was always intended to be.
> The growing failure of the USDA to serve and protect organic farming was the catalyst that united us. 
> The farmers of the Real Organic Project have created an add-on label to USDA organic, to differentiate organic food produced in concert with healthy soils and pastures. This is not a new concept. In the EU there are respected add-on labels to the European organic program that offer customers greater transparency. Organic farmers across the country have been quick to join.
