# Food Spaces Home


This idea of food spaces at home is also influenced by the idea of JOMO* 
## JOMO: Elevating the Home Dining Experience

A significant shift in social dynamics is materializing through the phenomenon known as JOMO (Joy Of Missing Out), which represents a deliberate pivot away from external social engagements toward enriched home-based experiences. This trend reflects a fundamental recalibration of how people choose to socialize, with many preferring the comfort and customization of home environments over traditional out-of-home venues. Unlike the earlier FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) that drove people to public social spaces, JOMO celebrates the richness of intimate gatherings in personal spaces, enabled by sophisticated home culinary capabilities[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-food-drink-top-trends-202526-naomi-barry-nm98e).

The next decade will see this trend accelerate as homes transform into primary social hubs equipped with restaurant-quality meal preparation capabilities, barista-grade coffee machines, and high-end entertainment setups. This evolution moves beyond mere convenience to create highly personalized social spaces where hosts can craft experiences impossible to replicate in commercial establishments. The technological enablement of home dining experiences—through advanced food delivery platforms, meal kits with professional-grade ingredients, and smart kitchen appliances—will further blur the distinction between restaurant and home-cooked meals, making the latter increasingly competitive as venues for meaningful social connection[1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-food-drink-top-trends-202526-naomi-barry-nm98e).

## Silestone Institutes and Cosentino Study 
Global Kitchen Trends,[ Cosentino](https://www.cosentino.com/news/the-kitchen-of-the-future-a-multifunctional-hyperconnected-and-health-focused-space/)
> To this end, we have launched the Global Kitchen project, an international platform for analyzing and disseminating valuable knowledge about the home kitchen space. We are pleased to present. Renowned international experts in various disciplines will contribute their views and comment on the future of the home kitchen.
> 	![[The-Kitchen-of-the-Future_Silestone-Institute-3.avif]]
> **Key predictions in the Global Kitchen report include:**
- The kitchen will be a hyper-connected, multi-functional space for work, leisure, health and relaxation.
- It will incorporate techniques and smart devices normally found in professional kitchens such as vacuum cooking and packaging.
- It will further cement its role as the centre of the home'; the largest and most invested room in the house.
- The kitchen will develop as a multi-functional space in all countries and is expected to disappear as an independent room.
- Its design will not only take aesthetics and function into account but also emotional value and it will strengthen its use as a space for relaxing and well-being.
- Connectivity and smart appliances will be managed from mobile and wearable devices and will not only make shopping and laundry easier, but ensure endless access to information from the Internet of Things.
- The worktops will be able to cook, make calls, broadcast TV or provide access to the internet. They will be height adjustable, contain recipe databases where chefs will guide the user through the method and ingredient information and be able to weigh food.
- The refrigerator will offer permanent access to nutritional information on screens.
- They will be sustainable, with solar-powered appliances solar powered and will be aligned with Multi- R' thinking - Rethink, Redesign, Repair, Reuse, Remanufacture, Recover.
- Intelligent lighting will be variable to match the time of day, mood or the type of food being cooked.
> Forecasting and Sales Experts' Opinions on the Future of the Home Kitchen** 842 kitchen professionals from eight countries (Australia, Brazil, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Italy, Portugal and Sweden) 
- 87% of respondents said that the kitchen would become more relevant as an activity and meeting place in the house. (In many countries, the kitchen is a separate room).
- 3% imagine the work surface will incorporate weighing scales and nutritional analysis.
- Australia and Brazil agree that the new cooking methods will be the most important development, while the UK and Italy prefer smart appliances. In contrast, Spain and the US value connectivity above all.
> The kitchen will be consolidated in the coming years as a meeting and leisure space for family members. Kitchens will continue to be designed with an opening to the dining and living room for seamless integration..

## Home Consumption Patterns

Food Consumption Trends 2025
Perplexity
The home kitchen has become a site of increased technological integration, with AI-powered appliances and digital platforms transforming domestic food preparation. Smart refrigerators can now inventory contents and suggest recipes based on available ingredients, while cooking apps provide step-by-step guidance calibrated to individual skill levels[3](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/01/19/food-trends-2025-how-social-media-ai-and-in-person-events-will-shape-what-we-eat). This technological augmentation of home cooking addresses common pain points related to meal planning and preparation while encouraging culinary exploration and skill development.

Beyond technology, home consumption patterns reflect growing interest in fermentation and traditional food preparation techniques. Super sourdough has emerged as a particularly notable trend, expanding beyond bread to include crackers, baking mixes, and pastas[2](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/top-5-food-trends-2025-sourdough-bread-protein/story?id=117981962). The appeal of fermented foods like sourdough extends beyond flavor, as these products offer potential health benefits including improved nutrient absorption through lactic acid content and prebiotic effects that support microbiome health[2](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/top-5-food-trends-2025-sourdough-bread-protein/story?id=117981962). This renaissance of traditional food preparation methods represents a meaningful counterbalance to the simultaneous acceleration of food technology.

Zero-waste approaches to home cooking have gained significant traction, with consumers becoming increasingly conscientious about food waste and its environmental impact[3](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2025/01/19/food-trends-2025-how-social-media-ai-and-in-person-events-will-shape-what-we-eat). This has manifested in creative culinary practices that utilize traditionally discarded food parts, such as carrot-top pesto and beetroot-leaf salads. The zero-waste movement reflects broader environmental concerns while also addressing economic considerations, as households seek to maximize the value derived from food purchases.

**Long-Term Projections (Beyond 2030)**
Perplexity 
The household kitchen may evolve dramatically beyond 2030, potentially incorporating advanced food preparation technologies that automate complex cooking processes while accommodating personalized nutritional requirements. These developments could democratize access to sophisticated cuisine while potentially reducing resource consumption through precise ingredient utilization. The challenge will be preserving the creative and experiential aspects of cooking within increasingly automated systems.


## Insights 

2030 Beyond Laura's Insights
This means packaged food that integrates with the kitchen. A package will be scanned into your home (similar to the new models of supermarkets that scan what is in your bag), all of the details will be integrated into your smart kitchen, and the smart kitchen will generate recipes based on ingredients, expiration dates, time of preparation, serving size, and dietary preferences. Additionally, your kitchen will be able to make a shopping list for you and then order the items for delivery.
