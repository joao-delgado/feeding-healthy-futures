# Multi-Functional Co-Working Space 

[Foodlab. Hamburg](https://foodlab.hamburg/)
> The foodlab in Hamburg's Hafencity is a place for foodies. In addition to flexible kitchen spaces for testing, creating, and producing food innovations, we offer a coworking space (also for non-foodies), networking opportunities, community events, and test areas for various food concepts.
> The foodlab is open not only to makers but also to all connoisseurs. Whether it's cinnamon knots from the in-house café or lunch and dinner from new concepts in the pop-up restaurant – everyone can experience the foodlab according to their own taste.
