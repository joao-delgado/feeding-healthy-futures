## Drive-Through Bans the United States, [Reason](https://reason.com/2024/09/07/drive-thrus-are-booming-why-are-cities-banning-them/)
> Yet even while Gen Zers are [frequenting](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/dining/drive-through.html) drive-thrus and filming their visits for a TikTok trend, city governments are veering hard in the other direction. Nearly every month, news comes of another city moving to ban new drive-thrus. Minneapolis kicked off the trend in 2019 by [banning](https://www.foodservicenews.net/article-archive/drive-thru-restrictions-in-minneapolis-and-st-paul/article_05d03069-0e2e-5dfe-8210-7c21afa3871a.html) new drive-thru windows citywide. In 2023, Atlanta followed suit with its own [ban](https://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta-news/atlanta-city-council-oks-two-laws-intended-to-reduce-beltline-traffic/GPDWIUYBMNDM5KRQEBHQGGH2SI/#:~:text=Atlanta%20City%20Council%20OK's%20two%20laws%20intended%20to%20reduce%20Beltline%20traffic,-Credit%3A%2) on new drive-thrus within a half-mile of the Beltline. Cities such as [St. Paul, Minnesota](https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2024/06/10/st-paul-drive-thru-fast-food-coffee-carbucks-proposal), and [Annapolis, Maryland](https://www.eyeonannapolis.net/2024/07/plastic-bags-banned-in-annapolis-drive-thrus-may-be-next/), have recently jumped on the bandwagon with proposed bans.
> The Kellogg [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4790752) found that fast service restaurants with drive-thru windows saw a modest 4 percent decline in sales from 2019 to 2022. Meanwhile, those without drive-thrus experienced a devastating 50 percent drop. That is [comparable](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4790752) to 25 percent of Starbucks customers—and 50 percent of the chain's total revenue—transitioning to drive-thru-only outlets.


Gas Stove Bans in United States
There have been cities trying to initiate gas bans for stoves, however, this poses serious issues for restaurants that require gas to prepare dishes. For now, the restaurant industry is fighting back so that this legislation does not go through. 
>[ A.P. News](https://apnews.com/article/berkeley-natural-gas-ban-settlement-f5a712dc8838fb524c8ceca36ba4eb74), BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) — The city of Berkeley, California, has agreed to halt enforcement of a ban on natural gas piping in new homes and buildings that was [successfully opposed](https://apnews.com/article/berkeley-california-natural-gas-ban-overturned-appeals-court-7dafca58d19963f322100d73caf9c31a) in court by the California Restaurant Association, the organization said.
