[[Centro de Papas - Cusco]]

The **Centro Internacional de la Papa (CIP)** and the **Parque de la Papa** in Peru are pivotal institutions dedicated to the preservation, research, and promotion of the country's rich potato heritage. Collaborating closely with indigenous communities and organizations like **Asociación ANDES**, these centers offer invaluable insights into traditional agricultural practices and the significance of potatoes in Andean culture.

### 🥔 Insights

#### 1. **Parque de la Papa: A Community-Driven Conservation Effort**

Located in the Sacred Valley near Cusco, the Parque de la Papa is managed by six Quechua communities. Together, they cultivate and protect over 1,300 native potato varieties, preserving both the biodiversity and the ancestral knowledge associated with these crops. The park serves as a living museum, showcasing traditional farming techniques and the cultural importance of potatoes in Andean society.

#### 2. **Traditional Preservation Methods: Chuño and Moraya**

Andean communities have developed unique methods to preserve potatoes:

- **Chuño**: Potatoes are freeze-dried by exposing them to the cold Andean nights and then sun-dried, resulting in a lightweight, long-lasting product.

- **Moraya**: A similar process where potatoes are soaked in water after freezing, then dried, producing a white, less bitter product.

These methods not only extend the shelf life of potatoes but also enhance their nutritional value, making them essential for sustenance during long journeys or scarce periods.

# 3. CIP's Role in Potato Research and Breeding

Established in 1971 in Lima, the Centro Internacional de la Papa focuses on research and development of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and other Andean roots and tubers. CIP's breeding programs aim to improve crop yields, disease resistance, and adaptability to climate change, ensuring food security for communities worldwide.

#### 4. **Collaborative Efforts with Asociación ANDES**

Asociación ANDES works alongside indigenous communities to protect and promote agrobiodiversity. Their partnership with CIP and local farmers has led to initiatives that safeguard traditional knowledge and ensure the rights of communities over their native crops.

#### 5. **Challenges of Patenting Native Varieties**

There is growing concern over the patenting of native potato varieties by external entities. Such actions can lead to biopiracy, where indigenous knowledge and resources are exploited without fair compensation or recognition. Efforts are underway to establish legal frameworks that protect the rights of indigenous communities over their genetic resources.([International Potato Center](https://cipotato.org/potato/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Native Potato Varieties - International Potato Center (CIP)"))
