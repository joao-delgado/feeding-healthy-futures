# Day 1
@pachecafe Chicken Sandwiches for Breakfast which cured my borderline oncoming hanger and energized me for the day ahead. I opted out of eating the plastic-looking cheese and ham sandwich on the plane. 

  @[pukupukucafe](https://www.instagram.com/pukupukucafe/#) Ground Coffee for the week, Mirador del Vraem- Espino. Peru Coffee chain, working with coffee-growing communities from the Amazonas region to Puno, paying a fair price directly to the farmers. 

  Chicha Morada- a Peruvian beverage, gets its distinctive purple color from purple corn (maiz morado). This corn variety is rich in anthocyanins, powerful antioxidants. 

Guardia Imperial Ceviche, white fish, sweet potato, corn, Palta(Avacado), capers, lime sauce to pour over 

Arroz con Mariscos

  @[cicloscafe](https://www.instagram.com/cicloscafe/#) Debating getting every single drink on the menu. I went in thinking I wanted a cold brew, only to realize that their menu was a coffee lovers delight of crafted beverages.  Ended up with a Ciclos Negroni, made with their coffee liqueur. Classic negroni, ending with a beautiful hint of coffee at the end of the palate.  Taahira got the Nitro tableside experience with chocolate, Ciclo Pisco, and coffee. 

  Debating Emoliente at the street vendors, a traditional Peruvian drink, often a warm winter beverage, made with roasted barley, medicinal herbs, known for its potential health benefits.   

  
# Day 2

Started the day with Maracuyá and Granadilla, a prized fruit in the pre-Inca period and during the times of the Viceroyalty.

Lunch @puntoazulperu - Causa Crocante 
Causa frita de yuca al panko cubierta de nuestra salsa escabechada con langostinos
flambeados y emulsión de palta.

Tiraditos - Pruebalos en Tradicional 
Tiraditos de pescado, toda una verdadera experiencia culinaria:
Parmesana, Olvio, Pesto. Aji Amarillo, Al Rocoto 

The use of sauces in this dish made the plate look like a spinning rainbow. The use of Parmesan is an unfamiliar accompaniment to fish crudo, it tastes good but seems out of place, a testament to the Italian influence in the cuisine. While olives in another pureed sauce created a unusual visual, with a pastel purple. 

PISCO SOUR - Pisco, jugo de limón, jarabe de goma y clara de huevo.

One sign stood out the most to me. Representing a recurring human history and the extent to which the desire for power and righteousness will burn down the foundations of culture and knowledge.  

“This exhibition represents more than 15,000 years of history. During this period, the textiles of several ancient Peruvian cultures underwent a process of technological development. As a result, by around 1500 AD, textile items possessed a powerful symbolic content that was understood by all. During the clash of cultures resulting from the European conquest of the Americas, an effort was made to destroy native textiles. They were burned en masse, because in common with other artistic expressions, they were seen as representative of the customs and religious practices of indigenous peoples.”
