Some learnings/observations of the day:

1. Punto Azul

Tiradittos - sashimi style with 5 different sauces (aji amarillo, rocotto, pesto, paramesan) served with a side of bonito (camote)

Also the corn goes through a process of nitxmalisation which is basically soaking it in an alkaline solution (ash or calcium?) and then removing it from the cob before toasting it to remove impurities 

The sauce they give with their corn (toastados?) is roccoto is one of the spiciest ever

2. Chifas* come from the chinese word of Chi fan (eat rice or eat!) and this is traditionally what they call chinese - peruvian restaurants. Also, peruvians have adapted words into Spanish that are from mandrin, like jiang (ginger) and soy sauce Sillao (viene del cantonés si yau (豉油), que significa salsa de soy)!!! increible!!
