 [[Confusion on healthy eating, various ideas on what good nutrition is]] 
 [[Diets]] 
 
 
 These are just a summary of ideas we observed and thought about 

- Bio diversity - the availability of nutrient-dense food because of food preservation of their biodiversity e.g, quinoa, kiwicha, potatoes. The chefs have fought against GMO, and the way the land is structured is harder for large-scale industrialization (e.g in Chile and Brazil)
- Millennial history guarded by indigenous people who are still taking care of the lands as it was before, and this is passed down and taken up by some entrepreneurs and younger generations 
- Effects of urbanization and the consequence of terrorism - 1/3 of the population moved to Lima, even though it is a food desert and it puts more strain on the agricultural ecosystem 
- Indigenous knowledge and traditions need to be documented in one way or another because oral traditions are not able to transmit the language in the same way as written text
- How we see and understand our own value is so important in understanding how we eat (like, many people in Peru ate burgers and fries, because of the low perception of quinoa, potatoes) 
- The importance of influence and chefs has power. They possess influence and can change perceptions around what is good and considered important to eat.
- Knowledge of cooking is so important - having someone who cooks at home, chefs who inspire you, or even social media is a critical way of getting more people into cooking itself.
	-  - The influence that food memories with family have on people's future 
		 - Karla to her Son, him getting a Culinary Degree  
		 - Rocio Grandmother/Parents, now operating a focused on Andean Cuisine restaurant 
		 - Palmiro Ocampo from his Auntie, becoming a chef 
- Travel and experience create an appreciation of your own country, culture, people and traditions. Many of the experts we spoke with traveled and gained insights that deepened their level of appreciation for their 'home'

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Millennial preservation is so important in keeping traditional knowledge, language, produce, and also just community!!!!!
- Living in the countryside is hard but at least the food is what you grow and earn. Living in the city can create more wealth, decrease connection to land, and affect quality of life. 
- Indigenous people are stewards of the land, but language is so important in connecting them to us and understanding the deeply valuable food traditions of plants as medicine!!! (Otherwise, the language and knowledge dies)
- The problems of patenting would be how it would work internationally? How could we commodify food by patenting it? Using the principle of food sovereignty, it would be unwise and unethical to patent certain basic produce if we believe that everyone should have access to quality food. 
- How we name things is so important in understanding the value of something - for example, papa was not first called papa, it was called Santor Mami - naming after the religious person/saint. In 1978, it was named papa after the Vatican to give it the importance of the Pope.  
- Indigenous knowledge can be passed in different ways (not just through the indigenous people themselves) it can be passed on through the act of maintaining the tradition, empowering farmers (Rocio from Nunya Rami - having an amazing restaurant in Cusco that serves regenerative healthy food) taking the knowledge, sharing it respectfully (Manuel Choqque through his wine making from Okas)
- The elderly women in the community were at least 75 years old, carrying heavy bags, jet black hair, and running around. The vitality could be because of value systems. Community, high nutritious food, skills (sewing), purpose (contributing to her family and heritage).
