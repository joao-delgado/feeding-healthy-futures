[[Diaspora & migration|Diaspora & migration]]

Peruvian cuisine’s roots extend deep into the pre-Columbian era. The indigenous people of Peru used to cultivate an array of crops, such as potatoes, quinoa, corn and chili peppers. These ingredients were the backbone of their diet. They mastered innovative techniques, like freeze-drying potatoes, to ensure a year-round food supply.

- First the Spanish Conquest , 
	- The arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in the early 16th century marked a significant turning point in Peruvian cuisine. The Spaniards introduced ingredients, such as wheat, rice and livestock, and techniques, like frying and baking. These new elements intertwined with indigenous cooking methods to create dishes, like arroz con pollo and empanadas, which are staples in modern Peruvian cuisine.[Travel Noire](https://travelnoire.com/peruvian-cuisine-a-history-of-cultural-fusion-through-centuries)
- Then African 
	- During the colonial period, African slaves brought to Peru contributed significantly to the fusion of flavors. They introduced ingredients, like plantains, yams and okra. They also introduced the art of slow-cooking stews and braising meats. This culinary cross-pollination gave rise to the famous Peruvian Creole cuisine. Dishes, like carapulcra, a spicy potato and pork stew, and tacu tacu, a savory bean and rice cake, are legacies of this African influence.

- Then Chinese mostly cantonese speakers in slave like conditions to opening bodegas and then Chifas
	- The first documented Chinese immigrants arrived in Peru in 1849 to work in coastal sugar plantations and mines, to construct rail roads, and to extract guano for fuel.

	- [Chifas](https://chifadukang.com/blog/chifa-culinary-legacy-chinese-peru/), 
- Then Japanese at the beginning of the 20th century, Nikkei Food 
	- Called Nikkei, the Japanese word for emigrants and their descendants — which is extremely popular far beyond the small population (less than 1%) of Japanese-Peruvians. A confluence of economic and social factors in the late 19th century precipitated the Japanese diaspora to the Americas, and Peru was sometimes advertised as a paradise by Japan's Meiji government. It wasn't. Recently independent Peru was still transitioning out of an economy that relied on slavery, and the system of indentured agricultural labor that replaced it was often brutal. In cities, quickly solidifying racialized divisions of labor meant Japanese immigrants worked menial or labor-intensive jobs while ghettoized in undesirable neighborhoods., [Food and Wine ](https://www.foodandwine.com/chefs/nikkei-peruvian-japanese-food)

- Italians in the turn of 19th century to 20th 
	-  This migration of Italians began to be consistent starting from 1840 thanks to the conspicuous economic growth of Peru, which was caused by the export of [guano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guano "Guano").(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Peruvians#cite_note-itals-5) Only after the unification of Italy in 1861 was there mass emigration, especially from the impoverished countryside of Veneto and broader Italy.
