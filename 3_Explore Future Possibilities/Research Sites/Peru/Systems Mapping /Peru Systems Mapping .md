# Peru Systems Mapping

## Enablers Dynamics
- Lots of influence from Amazonian fruit like Heirba Luisa, emoliente, etc 
- Wide influence of taste palettes from colonization and migration -Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Peruvian, Italian  
- Wellness promotion in stores with local products. Maca, Lumaca, Emoliente, etc. 
- Peruvians have access to great produce because of the diverse landscapes and microclimates. The country has a dry coastal region, the cool and varied Andean highlands, and the humid tropical Amazon basin.
- Community-driven farmers’ markets like Agroferia de Campesinas are accessible and offer good value for money for people across all income groups.
- A long history of culture and influence from the Incas or pre-Incans, who had a robust farming background and cultivation of diverse crops.
- Resurgence of Amazonian foods based on wellness trends, and the Amazon being exotic and also inaccessible. Food as a status, rarity, uniqueness, and limited access.  
- Tourism has added an extra boost to the type of food available - there are more international stores and offerings like gelato, bakeries, coffee shops, etc, which indicates the adoption of more 'international' food choices
- Bio diversity - the availability of nutrient-dense food because of food preservation of biodiverse crops, e.g, quinoa, kiwicha, potatoes, corn. The Peruvian chefs have fought against GMOs, and the way the geographical nature of the land is harder for large-scale industrialisation (Such as in Chile and Brazil)
- Lots of chefs are gaining recognition, changing, and influencing the public’s perception of Peruvian food.  From Gaston to Palmiro to Virgilio, they are inspiring pride in Peruvian national food.
- Agriculture accounts for 7.1% of Peru's GDP and 25.7% of employment. Agriculture has traditionally played an important role in the Peruvian economy and is the second major source of export earnings for the country after the sale of minerals.

## Behaviors & Rituals
- There is a big foodie culture. Peruvians appreciate eating out, from regular meals to snacks to drinks (Pisco, Emoliante, Chicha Morada, Chicha Jarra, etc)
- A strong food culture of people who enjoy eating together. Lines for lunch at 1 pm outside restaurants. 
- There is a heavy concentration of snack vendors to the point where you question the level of competition. Vendors with megaphones announcing items, tonics, sweets, breads, fruits, packaged junk foods (chips, cookies)
- There is an increased appreciation for farmers’ markets as a source of medicinal knowledge and offerings in digestible forms (Powdered Maca, for example) that have a correlation to the ancient knowledge brought by the Incas.
- There is pride in Peruvian cuisine, but at the same time, a disdain or disregard related to racism for heritage seeds and produce. For an e.g, the most widely used potatoes are shipped in from the Netherlands for fries when Peru has over 3,000 local varieties 
- There is an increased appreciation for farmers’ markets as a source of medicinal knowledge that matches the ancient knowledge brought by the Incas.
- **Virgilio and Central's Fame**The importance of influence and chefs in power - they can change perceptions around what is good and nice to eat. Now that Virgilio and those before him are focusing on traditional Peruvian produce, which increases interest and demand. 
- Going to the market and speaking with producers and other people is seen as a social part of life and a very common activity. There are various indoor markets throughout the week. It is a way to try products and get acquainted with tastes and flavours.

## Blockers Dynamics
- High level of government corruption. Many Peruvians are unhappy with how the government handles matters, with reference to the mafias.
- 50% of Peruvians are unable to afford food and proper nutrition. There are unofficial gatherings of women collectives called 'ollas’, to community source and cook food, but the government only provides less than 1 USD to buy food per meal.
- Economic differences. Access to affordable, healthy food. 
- Health food stores are abundant but the prices are out of reach for the general population. Seems to be more of an elitist level of access.
- Time scarcity and commuting. Most public transit relies on buses, however, they are cramped and distances are long. Lima ranks 7th globally for average travel time per 10 km and 9th for congestion intensity.
- Stressful city due to traffic congestion, noise and pollution.
- Peru, as a country, is a republic, and the country was created without respecting the individual rights of all the different indigenous groups. People from different ethnic groups find it difficult to agree on common ideas, and there is some difficulty in reaching a consensus.
- The education about nutrition seems to be limited, for example, in public schools, they don't learn about cooking or local nutrient-dense foods such as Quinoa. Some people say they have eaten Quinoa for generations, others say that it is chicken food. There is classism around certain food items. 
- Effects of urbanization and the consequences of terrorism - 1/3 of the population moved to Lima, even though it is a food desert, and it puts more strain on the agricultural ecosystem.
- High availability of fried, sugary, and salt-laden foods from street vendors and at convenience stores. Inca (high-sugar popular soda), fried Fish, hyper-processed packaged foods. 
- Pervasive colonization of the psyche of people. Less appreciation of the origin of culturally significant foods in the attempt to consume internationally, socially “sophisticated” food. An idea of what it means to be a modernized person eats, branded foods or international.   
- Indigenous knowledge and traditions need to be documented in one way or another because oral traditions and embroidery are less transmissible than through written text. 
- Lack of public access to drinking water. Reliant on sugary drinks for ‘hydration’. 
- There is not much publicity or advertisements on healthy eating, rather than signs on packaged foods saying this is high in sugar, fat or salt.
- Land grabbing. The growing number of large corporations buying out land in Amazon for palm oil deters the use of more biodynamic agricultural practices. 
- Many people in Peru ate burgers and fries because of the low perception of indigenous potatoes. All rotisseries import fries from Holland.
- There is a large presence of Fast Food chains in Lima, including KFC, Pizza Hut, Popeye's, Bembos (a local burger franchise), and McDonald's.
