Stop to Chorrillos, Lima to meet with Karla Gabaldoni of NOA. 
A strong member of the Slow Food Peru community and entrepreneur of a company that creates healthier food options with all high-quality Peruvian ingredients. Has hosted open tours of the facility to kids and used a clever tactic to get kids drinking more water by claiming it as the new cool beverage, H2O. As a small but impactful action in a place dominated by Inca Cola, a high-sugar soft drink that you see the general population having with meals. 

Inca Kola, Available everywhere and you can see people drinking it everywhere with lunch and dinner

Karla's connection to Slow Food and trip to Turin for the Terra Madre event were an inspirational moment. When she discovered that other people were interested in maintaining the integrity of their food, community, and culture. She eventually brought her sons. One son has been influenced by her so much, that he recently graduated from a Culinary school in Lima. 

Karla makes a wide variety of healthier snacking products. Grissini, crackers, low sugar oat-cookies, dried fruits, vinegars, sauces, granola, flavorings (dukkah, spice blends) All the products are made by hand. 


Key Findings 
 - The encoded trauma of terrorism that leaves one in a state of emergency 
 - The connection between trauma/poverty and the food that was eaten at that time, makes it hard to make healthy choices
 - The fact that the products are still all made completely by hand 
 - She creates a special label to help sell experimental products based on inspiration or the availability of ingredients
