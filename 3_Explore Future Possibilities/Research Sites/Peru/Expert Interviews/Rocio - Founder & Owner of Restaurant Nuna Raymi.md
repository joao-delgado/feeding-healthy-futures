### **Key Insights from Interview with Rocio, Founder of Nuna Rami (Cusco, Peru)**

1. Peru’s Millennial Food Heritage**

Rocio frames Nuna Rami as a place deeply rooted in Andean food culture and identity, aiming to recover and elevate Peru's ancient culinary wisdom. The restaurant’s ethos is built around ancestral knowledge and traditional ingredients:

- “The idea of Nuna Rami is to vindicate, revalue, and reposition the Andean food culture.”
    
- The name itself is rooted in Quechua: _"Nuna" means soul, and "Rami" means food — so food for the soul._ This reflects the holistic worldview of Andean cultures where nourishment is physical, emotional, and spiritual.
    
- The restaurant makes use of biodiverse native ingredients such as tarwi, mashua, oca, and quinoa, many of which were once undervalued or forgotten.
    

She emphasizes that traditional Andean food practices were highly nutritious and ecologically sound:

> “Our food culture is millenary and very rich in nutritional terms… but that has been lost with colonialism and later western influences.”

#### **2. Impact on the Surrounding Community**

Nuna Rami acts as a platform for community empowerment, especially for local producers and women:

- Rocio collaborates with local female farmers and small-scale producers from nearby communities like Ccorca and Anta:

> “We work directly with women farmers. They are the guardians of seeds and ancestral practices.”

- The restaurant sources ingredients from these networks, creating a circular and supportive food economy that uplifts indigenous and rural livelihoods.

Nuna Rami also functions as an educational space:

> “We are constantly doing workshops for kids and women to talk about nutrition, agroecology, and sovereignty.”

The team shares knowledge on how to cook traditional foods in a healthy and accessible way, encouraging younger generations to take pride in their heritage and understand the value of native foods.

#### **3. Feeding Healthy Futures**

Nuna Rami’s approach to food is intentionally decolonial, healthy, and educational. Rocio speaks about the need to address malnutrition in Peru not through imported ideas of “health,” but by returning to Andean knowledge:

> “People think processed yogurt or cereals are healthy. But we try to show that tarwi or kañiwa are superfoods our ancestors already used.”

Their dishes are plant-forward and based on principles of ecological sustainability. By centering taste and familiarity, the restaurant creates a bridge between tradition and the aspirations of a new generation:

> “If we can make these traditional foods tasty and beautiful, people will want to eat them again — and that is already a change.”


## Insights
Laura's Interview Phone Notes 

Parents were from the central highlands, but she grew up in Lima with the values of her parents, rooted in community, respect, and maintaining the Andean culture. A lack of respect for the traditional in Lima due to segregation, the need to adapt, by denial of their identity. In public, Rocio would eat other foods to integrate. More creole in the city, mix of indigenous with Japanese, Chinese, German, Italian. At home, she would eat traditional foods. While traveling to other countries, she saw a lack of traditional foods in places like Ireland. Began to appreciate the rituals of her upbringing and culture and the biodiversity of her country and the various types of languages, like Quechuan.

Grew up a lot with the Auntie and grandmothers and realized that she loved food. She was the first one to try the food, and her grandmother would ask her to taste as she prepared meals. A memory of, eating Chicharrón with rocoto at the street vendors. 
Heavily influenced by traveling around Peru as a family and going to markets in different regions. On family vacations, they would also go find the places were locals eat. 

Then she started with the restaurant 18 years ago. The last couple of years have been the best financially for Peru. Initially, she was working with tours and spreading the word about the restaurant to clients. Eventually bought out the shares to own the restaurant, which was co-owned with other friends. 

The farmers here work for family pride. There is a barter system. But more recently, some areas are spraying a lot of pesticides, for instance, with peaches. The local communities do not reinvest in public services and agricultural integrity. The crops being exported are going to resellers that undercut the price in the Lima market. 

Political corruption has played a huge part in Peru over the years. Mario Vargas Llosa (writer) was sidestepped by a Japanese leader who came to power in the 1990s. The mafia is the government. Indigenous people are supposed to have the right to their lands and territories, but new laws to remove this right and non-profit may not be able to act. 
There was a teacher who was voted as the president but was imprisoned and then claimed that the votes were false in 2023. The media took this and created propaganda around the situation my making the peaceful protests look like terrorism. 

The restaurant, Nuna Raymi, is working with about 20 farmers. 
One example, in the territory of Calca, Jessica, a farmer, Eco Hulla.
Jessica’s family was using pesticides, Jessica adapted some of the farm to regenerative agriculture. The grandmother farms in the traditional way. The mother, 60/70 now, started with the pesticides, starting in the 80s, the government promoted the chemical way. The traditional way used biodiverse blocks of land to prevent the spread of disease. Burning came later and the promoted method was breaking the barriers so monoculture could be done, and tractors could come through. In the Cusco, terraced agricultural systems, often featuring circular or stepped layouts, are known as "muyus" or "terrazas". These terraced fields were used by the Inca civilization for diverse agricultural purposes, including growing a wide range of crops at different altitudes and microclimates.

When trying to source directly from local farmers, there were barriers. When working with farmers to get the product directly there was trouble getting the necessary quantities. There was resistance at first. 

Most of the women are cooks. Now the professionals are men because they are the ones going to the schools. There is also still a fear of making traditional dishes tied with an emotional element to their preparation. One example, Traditional seco de Cordero, peanut curry with guinea pig. The level of food in Cusco is a little more plain/delicate and closer to the coast, there is more use of ingredients for more flavor. 

Having a lack of energy led to a curiosity of better nutrition. Her parents had a lot of energy. There is 30% less flavor and nutrients after 3 days of harvesting a crop. The Sacred Aalley is being bought up for housing, the soil is losing its nutrients. Chileans are buying up property in the Sacred Valley. Considered moving away, possibly to Salinas in California, but realized the value of living in her home country and has an appreciation for the quality of life. In CA, there was a scheduled life based on a time frame, everything planned with less time for spontaneity. The restaurant's rent may be an issue in the future, due to the infiltration of corporations buying properties in Cusco (Starbucks, Patagonia). 

The main goals are to regenerate the wealth into the company, labor, and farmers. Share and grow as a community.
