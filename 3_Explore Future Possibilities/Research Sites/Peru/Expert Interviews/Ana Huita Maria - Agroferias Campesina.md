## Key Insights from Interview with Ana Maria Huita – Agroferias Campesinas, Lima**

#### **Origins and Ethos of the Market**

- Agroferias Campesinas was born from _Gastro Viva_, an event that connected people across the food and agriculture industries.
- The market emphasizes **community, collaboration, and transparency**, with vendors supporting each other’s success.
#### **Product Innovation and Biodiversity**

- Producers have adapted traditional ingredients to modern tastes:
- **Quinoa pasta**, craft coffee and chocolate producers, and **sumac chips with rocoto** show a keen understanding of urban market demand.
- These products reflect “the idea that people want novelty or surprising ways to eat something simple like potatoes.”
- Use of **biodiverse crops** like native potatoes is not just cultural but strategic:
- “Biodiversity is important to prevent diseases from killing all their produce.”

## Consumer Experience and Accessibility

- The market attracts a **broad demographic**—people of different age groups and class backgrounds.

- Middle-class families from areas like Juan Manuel were surprised to find it **affordable**, which is “often not the case for farmer’s markets.”

- The market is a space of **social connection and trust**:

- As Diogo one of the patrons of the market noted, “It was important for the consumers to meet and talk to farmers.”

- Vendors frequently offer **free tastings without pressure**, encouraging openness and exploration.
#### **Cultural and Infrastructural Context**

- A visit to the **Surquillo 2 municipal market** revealed the importance of infrastructure in supporting local food:

- Upgrades like **metal roofing, refrigerators, and floor drainage** show how physical systems affect the visibility and viability of fresh, local produce.

- Ana Maria reflected on paradoxes in the global food system:

- Hector, a fig farmer, mentioned _“organic farms in Mexico run by cartels,”_ raising questions about ethics and control in food systems.

#### **Food as Symbol and Heritage**

- When asking Hector about who he sells his figs to, he mentions a specific group of intellectuals purchasing them:

- “People were eating figs because Socrates apparently ate figs—it was  philosopher’s fruit.”

- This reflects how certain foods become status symbols or markers of intelligence and wellness.
#### **Personal Reflections and Broader Shifts**

- Ana Maria’s time abroad (PhD in London) gave her new insight into Peru’s food culture.
- Her family’s health challenges pushed her toward **more conscious, healthy eating**—a path many Agroferia consumers also follow:

- Some patrons mentioned coming to the market due to health concerns, finding a return to traditional foods helpful.

- Media has played a role in democratizing food appreciation:

- “TV-induced gastronomy even in markets” helped increase popularity of local, homemade food, **without the pretension of fine dining**.
