**Background & Mission**  
Manuel Choqque is an agronomist and founder of _Oxalis Wine_, an enterprise that also leads a project called _Super Papas_ (Super Potatoes). For over 15 years, he has been researching and reviving ancestral Andean knowledge about native potatoes. His goal is to rescue, genetically improve, and elevate the nutritional and cultural value of native Peruvian potatoes, especially in a market that often sees them as poor or secondary food items.

### **Origins of the Potato**

- The potato was domesticated in the Andes, near Lake Titicaca, around 8,000 years ago.
- Initially, wild potatoes were toxic, containing around **95% solanine** (a toxic compound) and only 5–10% carbohydrates.
- Early Andean communities learned how to detoxify potatoes by mimicking the behavior of birds, such as parrots, who consumed **“chaco”**, a type of mineral-rich clay that neutralizes toxins.
### **Ancestral Technology & Biodiversity**

- Peru is home to over **1,200 wild species** of potatoes and about **6,400 domesticated varieties**.
- Ancient Andean farmers cross-pollinated wild species to create new, more palatable and safer hybrids, much like how tomatoes or eggplants (also in the Solanaceae family) are bred today.
- These early farmers observed the plants forming small green tomato-like fruits, which contain seeds. By selecting seeds from these fruits, they were able to generate biodiversity—not just by planting tubers but by cultivating from seed.
- Manuel notes that modern cultivation often relies on tubers, which limits diversity, while ancestral methods created resilient and nutrient-rich varieties.

### **Myth-Busting & Nutritional Value**

- One of the goals of the _Super Papas_ project is to challenge the global perception that potatoes are low in nutrients.
- In Peru, although potatoes are widely consumed, they are still seen as a side dish, not a nutrient-dense food.
- Manuel has identified and cultivated **386 high-antioxidant and nutritionally dense varieties** from the 6,400 that exist.
- Many of these potatoes have **vibrant pigments**, which not only indicate high antioxidant content but also provide ecological adaptability and culinary appeal.
- His _Super Papas_ varieties have **10x the antioxidants and 5x the vitamin C**, along with essential minerals like **iron and zinc**—making them especially valuable for **Indigenous children** with limited access to protein-rich diets.
- He emphasized the **amount of time and labor** required to hand-pollinate and develop these varieties.
### **New Uses: From Food to Cosmetics**

- Manuel is now collaborating with chemical engineers to extract natural pigments from these potatoes for use in:

    - **Textile dyeing**
    - **Cosmetics** (e.g., lip creams, skincare)
    - **Natural food coloring** (e.g., for ice cream and cheese)

- He’s also producing **vodka from native potatoes**.
- Future projects include **natural paints** derived from pigmented potatoes for Andean art.
### **Introducing Oca & Oxalis Wine**

- His business is named **Oxalis Wine**, a nod to the _Oxalis tuberosa_ (oca), another native Andean tuber domesticated alongside the potato.
    
- Oca is rich in antioxidants and potassium, and unlike potatoes, it can be eaten raw due to its low toxicity.
    
- Some oca varieties taste like fruits—green oca resembles green apples, while red varieties resemble berries, cherries, or watermelon.
    
- This fruity profile inspired Manuel to develop an **alcoholic beverage** made from oca, reviving a memory from his childhood when he used to eat it raw.
    
- He observed that **our childhood foods shape our imagination and innovation**, using the memory of oca’s flavor to develop something new.
    
- His idea to create **wine from oca** was **entrepreneurial and pioneering**, since no one had done it before.
    
- He is also developing **tourism offerings**, including wine tastings and visits to his production facility, which could **generate economic opportunities** for his remote community.
    
### **Challenges, Bravery & Patents**

- Manuel is working to **patent his Super Papa varieties**, a move that has stirred **controversy** within the agricultural community due to concerns over ownership and traditional knowledge.
- He shared that **his neighbors often think he’s crazy**, since he’s doing something no one else in his region is doing.
- **Bravery**, he emphasized, is critical for pursuing such unconventional work in isolated rural areas.
