# Palmiro Ocampo – Contributions to Healthy, Sustainable Food Futures

## Food Waste Valorization

- Palmiro champions **“optimal cooking”** – a zero‐waste culinary method born in Peru – that uses every part of each ingredient. He explains it has three functions: _preserving_ (prolonging shelf-life), _culinary recycling_ (extracting more food from each ingredient), and _plus-product_ (treating each part of an ingredient as valuable).

- He trains cooks in **“culinary recycling”** techniques so that “more than a tonne of ingredients that would normally end up in the garbage have been turned into delicious food”. In his words, _“There is no such thing as waste… An ingredient has to be used in its entirety”_. For example, banana peels (rich in magnesium/zinc), radish leaves have more calcium than milk, and pea pods (high in iron) are incorporated into meals instead of thrown away.

- In workshops at soup kitchens and shelters, Ocampo’s team teaches people to cook nutritious meals from peels, stems and leaves. As Stop Hunger notes, in Lima’s low-income neighborhoods mothers learn to make _“tasty meals on a small budget, using local produce and leftovers, therefore eliminating waste.”_ These methods can transform scraps into valuable nutrition.

- At universities in Peru, Ocampo has even developed curricula on waste‐avoiding cuisine. He reports: “We also created culinary recycling courses for two Peruvian universities. We want to teach new generations to have social sensitivity through the kitchen”. By spreading these skills, he leverages gastronomy as a tool against hunger and waste.

## Community Empowerment

- Ocampo’s programs focus on marginalized communities. His NGO CCori runs **“Kind Kitchens”** in soup kitchens and **“Optimistic Cuisine”** in [prisons](https://www.inpe.gob.pe/noticias-region-lima/item/4267-internos-del-ep-castro-castro-aprenden-reciclaje-culinario.html). These projects teach local cooks (often women) optimal cooking methods and source all ingredients from nearby small farmers, strengthening local food systems.

- He works closely with women leaders in community kitchens. For instance, in a Lima suburb, he collaborated with mothers who operate traditional collective kitchens, training them in sustainable cooking. Stop Hunger highlights that _“mothers play a key role in this creative and eco-friendly nutrition program”_ (a Sodexo–CCori initiative) where they learn to feed hundreds with minimal waste. One 76-year-old cook now prepares 150 meals daily using carrot, potato, and pea peels she once discarded.

- By empowering cooks of all ages and backgrounds, Ocampo’s work builds community capacity. A soup-kitchen leader notes that CCori “has taught us to … create healthy dishes” from ingredients formerly discarded. Programs like _Cocinas Bondadosas_ (Kind Kitchens) explicitly _“empower women in the fight against hunger”_ by strengthening their culinary skills (in partnership with Stop Hunger and Sodexo).
## Education and Capacity Building

- Education is central to Ocampo’s mission. He founded [Ccori Cocina Óptima ](https://ccori.org.pe/programas-sociales/) with his wife, Anyell San Miguel, whom he gives great credit to in 2014 to _“investigate and develop educational programs of food optimization for community kitchens”_. He has taught courses at culinary schools and universities (e.g. Le Cordon Bleu Lima, San Ignacio de Loyola, Universidad del Pacífico) on sustainable techniques.

- Through training programs, Ocampo reaches new generations. As he says, the goal is for his courses to be _“one of the tools to cure world hunger…[and] raise awareness that food can be better utilized”_. For example, CCori’s university programs incorporate social awareness into cooking. The Good.is interview notes he offers _“culinary recycling”_ workshops at colleges, aiming to instill social sensitivity in future chefs.

- He also educates beyond Peru. Ocampo co-authored **Sabrosos Insectos Peruanos** (a book on edible insects) and collaborated with the Nordic Food Lab on the Phaidon volume _On Eating Insects_. He created online courses (via Scoolinary) on cooking with insects and sustainable proteins, spreading knowledge of new, nutritious ingredients globally.

## Cross-sector Collaboration

- Palmiro forms partnerships with governments, NGOs and corporations to scale impact. Notably, **Sodexo** and its charity Stop Hunger work with Ccori on the _“Cocinas Bondadosas”_ program. Stop Hunger describes it as a Sodexo–CCori program that teaches mothers in poor neighborhoods to cook affordably and sustainably. Through this alliance, Sodexo/Stop Hunger trained 53 local kitchen leaders (out of Peru’s 13,000 soup kitchens) to optimize ingredients and fight malnutrition.

- His work is recognized by international institutions. Ocampo is a **WWF Peru Ambassador** and was appointed a UN World Food Programme _Zero Hunger_ ambassador, reflecting broad support for his vision. He even led the official UN 2017 conference lunch in Rome, linking haute cuisine to global food policy.

- In academia and industry, he collaborates on research projects. For example, he worked with the Nordic Food Lab (Chef Noma’s research group) on food science, and companies like Repsol (via its Impulsared initiative) have engaged his expertise. (Repsol’s program documents list Ocampo as a cofounder of CCori involved in sustainable food projects.) These cross-sector links help translate culinary innovation into practical, scientific and market-driven solutions.
## Cultural and Biodiversity Awareness

- Ocampo emphasizes Peru’s rich food heritage and biodiversity. He reminds us that Peru grows _“more than 4,000 [potato] varieties”_ – a cultural treasure he argues should be honored in kitchens. In practice, he promotes _“nose-to-tail”_ cooking of plants, using even potato peels to create dishes like **potato-peel chicken nuggets**. This draws on traditional knowledge (ancestors ate roots, leaves and tubers) and modernizes it into zero-waste cuisine.

- He links cooking to cultural identity. Palmiro calls food a “language” that connects people: _“Food to me is a language. We can communicate through food in a way that we can’t with words”_. By using native ingredients and techniques, his cuisine tells stories of Peru’s landscapes and peoples.

- Respect for biodiversity is fundamental. He states that the _“highest respect”_ for biodiversity is to fully utilize produce and eliminate waste. In other words, honoring a vegetable or grain means stretching it – fermenting, aging or recycling – rather than discarding it. This approach not only preserves nutrients but also safeguards diverse food traditions for future generations.
