# Chef Luís Valderrama on Peru’s Culinary Heritage and MIL’s Community Impact

## Peru’s millennial food heritage

- **Ancient staples and practices:** Peru’s Andes have millennia of crop domestication. Potatoes, for example, were a humble Inca staple and have been cultivated for thousands of years [latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/food/recipes/la-fo-co-virgilio-martinez-potatoes-recipes-20180526-htmlstory.html#:~:text=The%20potato%20has%20been%20cultivated,everywhere%2C%20even%20on%20the%20coast). Luis vividly describes a community _huatia_ (earth-oven) ritual: workers build a hill of heated stones, bury potatoes and tubers, then, after 45 minutes, dig them up and _“share this... to say thank you”_ – a harvest celebration of gratitude. This echoes ancestral customs of communal cooking and giving thanks.
    
- **Quinoa and native ingredients:** Quinoa and other Andean crops are deeply rooted in local tradition. Quinoa is often called the “mother grain” of the Andes – it was once sacred to pre-Columbian cultures – and today was praised by Bolivia’s president as _“an ancestral gift from the Andes to the world”_[daily.jstor.org](https://daily.jstor.org/quinoa-rise-of-an-andean-superfood/#:~:text=This%20year%20marks%20the%20tenth,alternative%20to%20common%20Western%20grains). Luis notes that until recently, many Peruvians thought of quinoa as “for poor people” (some even fed it to chickens), but rising awareness of its nutrition has changed that view. Indeed, researchers report that over _4,000 varieties_ of native potatoes exist in Peru and Bolivia[latimes.com](https://www.latimes.com/food/recipes/la-fo-co-virgilio-martinez-potatoes-recipes-20180526-htmlstory.html#:~:text=There%20are%20over%203%2C000%20varieties,seen%20over%20400%20of%20them), underscoring the country’s biodiversity. MIL highlights this diversity: its tasting menu is _“an introduction to the Andes”_, featuring a kaleidoscopic array of regional potatoes and multiple quinoa varieties[eatforum.org](https://eatforum.org/learn-and-discover/culinary-solutions-to-the-dual-crises-of-climate-change-and-biodiversity-loss/#:~:text=Their%20eight,quinoa%20grains%20and%20herbal%20plants).
    
- **MIL’s role in preservation:** MIL actively works to preserve and promote these heritage foods. Luis explains that at MIL (whose name means “thousand”), the team partners with nearby Quechua communities to gather roots, herbs and grains. _“They work with native communities… which provide the roots, herbs, and produce that are used at Mil. They are in the process of naming, classifying and studying them,”_ he says[sogoodmagazine.com](https://www.sogoodmagazine.com/pastry-blog/from-chef-to-chef/luis-david-valderrama-local-availability-product-creative/#:~:text=When%20we%20arrive%20we%20were,own%20liquor%2C%20spirit%20or%20alcoholic). In practice, every course uses local ingredients – one guest noted dishes are 100% local, drawing on “over 4,000 types of potato grown in Peru” – and the restaurant even has its own botanical garden of super-grains and tubers[aracari.com](https://www.aracari.com/blog/aracari-team-insights/mil-the-best-restaurant-in-the-sacred-valley/#:~:text=regional%20produce%20such%20as%20the,8%20of%20them%20I%20was). By cooking and teaching with these ancestral crops, MIL revalues them and keeps traditional knowledge alive.

## MIL’s community impact and healthy food futures

- **Collaboration with farmers:** MIL has built strong ties with local farmers. The Martínez family even funded new irrigation so villagers can grow _“clean and healthy”_ crops year-round. In exchange, _“the communities provide crops for the restaurant”_ and can sell any surplus at better prices [aracari.com](https://www.aracari.com/blog/aracari-team-insights/mil-the-best-restaurant-in-the-sacred-valley/#:~:text=The%20social%20project%20with%20nearby,higher%20price%20in%20the%20markets). 
- Luis stresses that MIL pays fair wages for all harvests – it’s _“not just extracted”_ – and shares the bounty. For example, if MIL needs more potatoes it works with producers like Manuel Choqque Bravo, and then its supply (and surplus) is shared with sister restaurants. In this way MIL injects cash into the local economy and ensures small farmers benefit directly from native crops.
    
- **Hiring and training locals:** MIL brings local community members into the operation. Young people from nearby villages work in the kitchen and dining room, receiving training in cooking and hospitality. Reviewers note that MIL’s staff (often local youth) are _“well informed on the ingredients”_, so that guests _“are also learning about the agricultural specifics of the country”_ from them[aracari.com](https://www.aracari.com/blog/aracari-team-insights/mil-the-best-restaurant-in-the-sacred-valley/#:~:text=regional%20produce%20such%20as%20the,8%20of%20them%20I%20was). Luis likewise says they _“prepare [community members] how to cook,”_ teaching them skills while also learning from their farmers’ knowledge. This two-way training builds skills and pride: cooks learn local Qechua terms and harvesting tips, and youth gain new livelihood skills without leaving home. Our host, Maribel, was able to explain the nuances of ingredients because she grew up on this land and explored outside as a child. She could explain the specific usage of plants and how her mother used them to alleviate ailments when she was growing up. 
    
- **Supporting healthy diets:** By spotlighting traditional produce, MIL helps shift dietary attitudes and promotes health. Wealthier customers increasingly _“understand the correlation between eating well and living well,”_ Luis observes, so they are willing to pay for nutritious, native ingredients. MIL’s educational approach – explaining ingredients and their benefits – helps erase old stigmas. For instance, a food expert recounts how MIL’s courses span eight high-altitude ecosystems, and guests _“learn about the work”_ with farmers (3,600 m up in Moray) including about hundreds of native potatoes, maca and kinako (Peruvian superfoods)[aracari.com](https://www.aracari.com/blog/aracari-team-insights/mil-the-best-restaurant-in-the-sacred-valley/#:~:text=regional%20produce%20such%20as%20the,8%20of%20them%20I%20was)[aracari.com](https://www.aracari.com/blog/aracari-team-insights/mil-the-best-restaurant-in-the-sacred-valley/#:~:text=The%20social%20project%20with%20nearby,higher%20price%20in%20the%20markets). Over time this visibility and knowledge-sharing is changing minds: quinoa and Andean tubers are no longer seen as merely “poor people’s food,” but as valued elements of a healthy future diet.
