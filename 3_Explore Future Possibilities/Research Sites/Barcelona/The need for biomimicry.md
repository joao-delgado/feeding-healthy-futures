Founder of Sowly, Natalia Brankowtiz critique of tech/startup culture’s obsession with speed, efficiency, and scale.

She emphasizes the importance of following nature’s rhythms, as it is seen in nature. “You cannot serve a dream if you’re reproducing toxic systems. The startup model doesn’t allow slowness.”
