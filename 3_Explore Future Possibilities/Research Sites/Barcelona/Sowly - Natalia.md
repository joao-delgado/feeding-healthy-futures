## Key Insights 
### 1. **Transparency ≠ Accessibility**

While Natalia emphasizes transparency (e.g., sharing producer details, telling the "story" of food), they acknowledge that this alone doesn’t guarantee accessibility. Information overload and consumer apathy or burnout often block deeper engagement.

> “Most people don’t even read the product info if it’s too long… it’s not about just sharing everything—it’s _how_ you share it.”

### 2. **Sustainability Requires Time—and Time is a Privilege**

Many people can't access “sustainable” options because their time is consumed by survival and overwork. The speaker notes that systemic pressure makes it hard for people to prioritize ethical choices, even if they care.

> “No one takes the time to actually put effort into where they're shopping… they don’t have time.”

### 3. **Healing Trauma is Key to Regenerative Systems**

Natalia draws a deep connection between sustainability, trauma, and healing. Their own shift from workaholism to co-founding a platform like Foley was catalyzed by therapeutic work like EMDR.

> “Sustainability is about slow living… healing trauma… education. Everything else is aftermath.”

### 4. **Startups Mimic the Systems They Aim to Disrupt**

There’s a critique of tech/startup culture’s obsession with speed, efficiency, and scale. These dynamics reproduce the very extractive values that sustainability movements claim to oppose.

> “You cannot serve a dream if you’re reproducing toxic systems. The startup model doesn’t allow slowness.”

### 5. **Relational, Local Networks Are Already Working**

In Catalonia, Natalia points to cooperative food models, neighborhood food groups, and farmer-consumer relationships that are already shifting the paradigm. The work is slow and often fragmented due to pride and protective tendencies within groups—but still deeply promising.

> “There’s a lot happening… neighborhood corporations that order food from farmers directly… this is a good place to start.”

# Solutions for Access & Accessibility
### 1. **Radical Slowness as Design Ethic**

- Shift from urgency and metrics to slow, iterative processes.
- Build tech that allows people to pause, reflect, _and connect_.
- Use rituals (like farmer visits, storytelling dinners) that restore relational access—not just transactional access.

### 2. **Layered Information Models**

- Let people opt in to depth. Start with storytelling, not specs.
- Provide transparency in _digestible_, story-led formats: visual cues, personal narratives, interactive filters.
- Embed accessibility tools for neurodivergent and time-poor users (e.g. voice notes, short summaries, filters by values like “women-led” or “low-impact”).

###  3. **Trauma-Informed Platform Design**

- Recognize that guilt and overwhelm block engagement. Replace moralistic framing with care-based language.
- Invite people to build a practice, not perform perfection.
- Include mental wellness and social connection as pillars of food systems work.
### 4. **Bridge Digital with Local**

- Map and support grassroots efforts like Catalan cooperatives or punk winemakers.
- Build tools that amplify, federate, or connect these systems without flattening them.
- Use the platform to support coordination, not control—highlight relational trust, not just supply chains.

###  5. **Interrogate Internal Culture**

- Live the values: co-design, democratic work culture, flexible pace.
- Allow the company to be a prototype of the slow, healing systems it advocates for.
- Prioritize ethical labor practices and emotional sustainability _within_ the platform team.
