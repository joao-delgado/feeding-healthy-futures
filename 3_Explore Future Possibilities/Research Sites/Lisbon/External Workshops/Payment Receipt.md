This radar chart reveals a striking contradiction between stated environmental concerns and actual behavioral commitments.

The most chosen habits center around local/seasonal eating (27 - the highest by far) and conscious consumption - "Buy with Conscience" (21) and "Taste the unexpected" (21). People are most willing to commit to changes that feel positive and experiential rather than restrictive.

The least chosen habits are telling: "Plastic Free Pioneer" (around 2-3), "Become a nutritional detective" (around 3), and "Shrink your carbon footprint" (around 3) sit at the very center of the chart. These are the most direct environmental actions, yet they're the ones people are least willing to commit to.

This exposes a fascinating psychological pattern. While people express deep concern about sustainability and want to "Buy with Conscience," they're reluctant to adopt the specific behaviors that would have the most environmental impact - like eliminating plastic or directly reducing their carbon footprint.

The high commitment to "Eat more local and seasonal" (27) might feel sustainable but is actually more about supporting local community and enjoying variety. Meanwhile, the low scores for "Plastic Free Pioneer" and "Shrink your carbon footprint" suggest people want to care about the environment in ways that don't require significant lifestyle changes or inconvenience.

It's also notable that "Reclaim cooking skills" (12) scores moderately - people want to engage more with food preparation, but aren't necessarily ready to tackle the harder systemic changes that would make their food choices genuinely more sustainable.
This suggests there's a gap between environmental values and willingness to adopt the behaviors that would actually address those concerns most directly.
