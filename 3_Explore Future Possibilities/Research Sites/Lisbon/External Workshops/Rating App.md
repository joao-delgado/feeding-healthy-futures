The overwhelming majority claim high responsibility: 42.1% say they're "Completely responsible" and believe personal choices drive systemic change, while 31.6% feel "Very responsible" - that's nearly 74% who see themselves as having major responsibility for food system transformation.

Yet this directly contradicts their actual commitments. In the habits chart, people pledged to adopt behaviors that were largely about personal experience and enjoyment: "Eat more local and seasonal" (27), "Buy with Conscience" (21), and "Taste the unexpected" (21). Meanwhile, they showed minimal commitment to the behaviors that would actually fulfill this stated responsibility - "Plastic Free Pioneer," "Shrink your carbon footprint," and other direct sustainability actions scored at the bottom.

This reveals a significant cognitive dissonance. People intellectually believe they should be responsible for systemic change and genuinely feel that burden, but when it comes to actual behavioral commitments, they gravitate toward choices that feel good rather than choices that would meaningfully address the systemic issues they claim to feel responsible for.

It's not that people don't care - they clearly feel the weight of responsibility. But there's a fundamental disconnect between acknowledging responsibility for "building a better food system" and being willing to adopt the inconvenient, restrictive behaviors that would actually create that change.

This gap between stated responsibility and actual commitment preferences suggests people may be experiencing guilt or anxiety about their role while simultaneously seeking easier ways to feel like they're contributing.
