# Night of Synergies
A Restaurant Experience

Night of Synergies is a collaboration between Transformative Times and Future Days on how to activate futures using immersive dinners. In May 2025, 57 guests participated in a collective reflection on food futures as a way to reflect on their daily choices. By hacking a typical dinner sequence, guests were confronted with dilemmatic options to identify current inhibitors and pathways toward a future of healthier choices. Their choices and reflections became the main research material for this micro report.
