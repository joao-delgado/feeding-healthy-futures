This triangular plot reveals a much more nuanced understanding of why people don't cook as often as they might like. The distribution of responses shows that most people don't see their cooking habits as driven by a single factor, but rather by a complex interplay of competing pressures.

The heavy concentration at the top suggests that fatigue from long work hours is the dominant factor - people genuinely feel too drained to cook after demanding days. This isn't about laziness, but about having limited energy reserves.

However, the spread throughout the triangle shows that people recognize this intersects with other factors. Many responses cluster toward the middle-left, suggesting a common combination of being tired AND feeling like cooking time could be better used for other priorities - perhaps family time, rest, or other responsibilities.

The right side shows fewer people attribute their cooking habits primarily to lack of motivation in a world of convenience, but those dots scattered along that edge suggest some people do struggle with the psychological barriers when easier options are always available.

What's particularly insightful is how few responses sit at the extreme corners - people rarely see their cooking habits as caused by just one factor. Instead, they recognize it as a systemic issue where work demands, competing priorities, and the friction of cooking in a convenience-oriented world all compound together.
This suggests that solutions focused on just one aspect (like meal prep efficiency or motivation) might miss the bigger picture of how modern life creates multiple simultaneous barriers to home cooking.

These maps reveals how people conceptualize their "ideal plate" - and it's fascinating how much goes beyond just nutrition or taste.

The largest segment is "Locally Sourced" at 7.2%, showing that connection to place and community is a top priority. This suggests people see their ideal meal as embedded in relationships with local producers and their regional food system.

What's striking is how story and meaning dominate over basic nutritional concerns. "With a story that makes it unique" (7.8%) is one of the largest segments, while "New flavour that I have never tried" (6.2%) shows people want their ideal plate to be an experience of discovery. Meanwhile, traditional health markers like "No Sugar" (1.7%) or "No added Salt" (2.4%) are relatively small.

The ethical dimensions are prominent - "Live longer and improve quality of life" (6%), "Certificate that supports biodiversity" (5.6%), and "With Sustainability certificates" (5.4%) show people view their ideal plate as a vehicle for broader values about environmental and social impact.

There's also a clear desire for sensory pleasure - "Makes the texture enjoyable" (9.6%) is the second-largest individual segment, and "Enhanced Flavour" (3.9%) appears separately. People want their ideal plate to be genuinely delicious, not just virtuous.
The cultural and spiritual aspects are notable too - "Express Cultural Values" (5.4%) and "Reflect cultural or spiritual beliefs" (4.8%) suggest people see food as deeply tied to identity and meaning-making.

Overall, this shows people's ideal plate is less about optimization (calories, nutrients) and more about connection - to place, story, values, pleasure, and identity. It's a holistic vision of food as culture, not just fuel.
