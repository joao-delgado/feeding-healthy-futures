# Social Supermarkets

We visited, spoke and cooked at Rizoma Cooperativa. Close to 500 people are collaborating to build food systems they are closer to. Connecting to share meals (there is a weekly cookout at lunch with leftover produce), work together (its a co-working space) and also shop locally sourced produce unanimously decided by its members.
