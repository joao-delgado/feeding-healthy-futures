# studies with contradictory findings

nutritional studies with contradictory findings. One week eggs are portrayed as healthy, the next week as problematic. This constant reversal of nutritional advice makes consumers feel that nutrition science is unreliable and that health claims based on it are similarly suspect. The resulting attitude becomes "why pay more for something that might be deemed unhealthy next month?"
