# Inconsistent Health Claim Standards

lacks rigorous standardization for what constitutes "healthy" on food packaging and marketing.

When consumers see contradictory products all claiming to be healthy (including obviously indulgent items with minor modifications), they develop systematic distrust of all health claims.
