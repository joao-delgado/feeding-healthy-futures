vegetarian food does not equal healthy food

In HK healthy food could be buddhist food

Vegetarian and healthy food was a trend 10 years ago and then it stabilized, not growing anymore. It has a stable community.

The majority of restaurants closes after 2y due to high costs. Its a very difficult business

The cost of living in HK is super high so there's been a growth of super cheap food that are really low quality

Girl's and Man go to different places to eat what what define the choice is atmosphere and alcohol. (more alcohol atracts guys) in the same way heavier foods & big portions also influence man choices

The biggest trend nowadays is the reduction of salt and sugar in food intake.

When they want ot go eat healthy they go to budhhist pplace beacause of low satl and flavor wnahncer

Trends come and go very very fast. Because after the initial hype they can't sustain themselves because of the high rents

healthy food is still very well connected to traditional chinese medicine
