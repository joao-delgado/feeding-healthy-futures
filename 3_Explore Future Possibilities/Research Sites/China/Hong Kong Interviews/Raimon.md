younger people are now tryuing to move away from alcohol for health reasions

theres a huge concern with skin care, specially women

People dont want to spend money on food because they think they are being tricked. They dont see the immediate value.

MSG is everywhere and is very difficult to avoid

because traditionally you would cook food for several hours to enrich the flavoours, but in a city that is always in a rush and full of people there's no time or the resources to for all that demand

so they put a lot of MSG in food to enhance the flavours to try to compensate for the lack of time to cook

Traditional food culture comes from parents, and its based in the idea of avoiding being sick

The biggest trend is now to avoid sugar. 0% sugar is the most wanted label in products.

There is a huge influence from Japan, they make good snacks that are also very functional

There is a correlation between personal identity and food consumer. I eat healthy, because I am special and I can afford. On the other hand, going to healthy labeled places is also a reflex that people have no time to search for healthy ingredients, "I dont have time, I just go there and I am sure it's healthy and fine". its a lot about trust

now industries are trying to make tea more a appealing to younger people, trying reinvent it

business and finance people usually try to go for lighter and less flavour heavy food to avoid bad breath smell

Going to a doctor is expensive so you have more preventive ways of living

Many people are influenced by instagram influences, who promisse great skin care by eating.

80% in advertising is about food, or skin care or vitamins. And it related with a hidden pandemic of people having a lot of skin problems due to what they eat. (mostly the levels of cancer and sugar levels)

In cantonese/chinese culture, they consider that cooking for more than 10min is too much time.

in most restaurant they serve you big portions of rice because is the most cheap way for people to feel full after eating

people are always looking for the umami flavor in food

Sofisticated HK people are concerned about food nowadays, Its a trendy topic

In the past people learn about food with their parents, but nowadays people make their own research and look for knowledge in other global places.
