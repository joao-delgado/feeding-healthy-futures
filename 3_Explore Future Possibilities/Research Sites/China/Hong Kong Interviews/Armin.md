## Vegan in HK struggling to navigate a meat heavy culture

healthy vegetarian food is very hard to find in HK
sometimes the best places to find it is in indian restaurants

in general people are not very well informed
they can put a chicken paw in a soup and assume that is still vegetarian because you can choose to not eat it

in the restaurante menus they usually dont say everything that comes in the place. so sometimes she orders something thinking it was veg but it had meat

People work long hours and are generally very tired, so cooking is not a priority. People eat mostly from delivery and on the go foods.

There is still the common culture that people need to eat something that gives energy to work, so many people like to eat meat and fat to gain energy.

In cantonese culture there is the perception that not eating meet will cause lack of vitamins and make them week, ultimately have illnesses.

People are addicted to vitamins as its perceived that is the best way to have a healthy diet.

healthy food is very expensive

Pork meat is celebrated in Chinese Culture and there is a shock between chinese and buddhist traditions

Diets are influenced by home dynamics (between couple, if someone in the family is vegan, the other person will be more open and eat it)

Choosing bio is not an option due to high costs and its imported

Social pressure to not be vegentarian

Food is a process of slow adoption, you need to slowly adapt to new tastes

Vegetarianism is fancy for young people
