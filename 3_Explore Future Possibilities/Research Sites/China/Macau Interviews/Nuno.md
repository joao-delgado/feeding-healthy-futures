## Local from Macau that works in the entertainment business. Born in Mozambique but lives in Macau for more than 30 years and is pro China

everything in Macau is somehow related to casinos

Culture production is very related with the casinos.

you basically only go to macau to gamble

everybody knows each other in Macau.

Celebration of the chinese culture and looking downwards over european culture.

there are now a bunch of new food emerging since the handover to China

theres a huge selection of different types of biscuits that chinese people buy to bring to their families because is the only thing thats affordable

for chinese people Macau is very expensive

the pastel nata really stuck here because that was the only thing portuguese people had to offer

they tried a lot of stuff but nothing really stuck like the pastel de nata

now they are trying to bring the pastel de bel√©m but that will fail
