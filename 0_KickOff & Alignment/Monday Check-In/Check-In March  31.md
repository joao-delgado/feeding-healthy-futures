> [!tt] 01 - Highlight of last week
> # What was your main highlight from last week's?
> (This could be a breakthrough, an interesting finding, or even a valuable lesson learned)

Taahira - 

Laura was in Barcelona, so together we did some cool things together inclduing meeting people, trying food/wine together. It was nice to visit stores and inspect bottles together in bcn, a reminder that our research is a living and breathing design of work and not just desk research. 


Laura
Developing a deeper connection with Taahira before we leave for Peru. And even discussing how we will handle the trip and our own personal needs. 

> [!tt] 02 - Findings and Patterns for team to know
> # Are there any emerging patterns or connections in your research that you think the team should know about?

- the correlation between food fast and fashion or fashion waste and food, this was very cool and something we learnt about that goes deeper into the research of zero waste

Also, seeing and documenting the amount of international food in barcelona was something that mirrored our research 

Laura 
The incoming technologies. We learned about satellites being used for accessing the soil, which blew my mind. Also, the meeting with Alessio, his use of AI and enrichment tools, to help update the platform he created FoodTech Data Navigator. 


> [!tt] 03 - Blockers
> # Did you encounter any unexpected challenges or roadblocks in your work process? What kind of support might help you address these in the future?

	Taahira: 


Laura 
Need to get access to the google drive for the Food Cluster Group

Laura 
To consolidate the findings from last week and get some more notes on trends in Obsdian. Start to reach out to potential connections in Peru. Get on board with the Central team.
