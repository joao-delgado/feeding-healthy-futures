Taahira -

Making sense of how our research on trends is coming up to 'match' the work we had done in phase 1. 

Laura 
The insight from Joao about taste preferences from Japan and the Middle East. The fact that Japan wanted Extra Virgin but the flavor was too strong for their palettes and dishes and that the Middle East wanted pomace put back into the oil.

> # Are there any emerging patterns or connections in your research that you think the team should know about?

Taahira - it is likely we are already living in some of the 'trends' of the future. Perhaps more then how new or what else is to come? Its to envision how else the current reality can be 'futurised' for an e.g

There is so much cross-over between wellness, healthy eating and also our gene make-up as explained by maria raimundo. so, it would be wise to look into this deeper intersection - how does sleep affect food, how does sex affect food, etc etc 

Laura
Wellness in Food- the two will continue to overlap and this functional terminology is developing in various food items.

> # Did you encounter any unexpected challenges or roadblocks in your work process? What kind of support might help you address these in the future?

Taahira - 

In general trying to see how Laura and I can move forward with Henrique - what kind of maps or tools can we get from him.
Laura and I are in a good flow but i feel it would be good to have help from maybe diogo ? or someone else to direct/distill our findings to the research

also for our interviews, i think its best to have some prepared qns sent beforehand so the people are not as caught off guard or have an idea of what we are asking

Making the loops and maps of our ideas

Laura 
Schedule some more interviews for next week. 
Have some ideas about the plan for Spain next week. 
Explore more about future grocery technologies that might be emerging and the trends around the types of places people are eating more(segmentation).

> [!tt] 05 - Housekeeping
> # What do we still need to discuss?


- My brother arrives in Lisbon from 20 - 29th, that week, I might try to work around our schedule to spend some time with him as I haven't' seen my family in a year, is that ok?
- Planning for Laura in Barcelona (people we should speak to, etc?)

Laura 
Thanks for buying the Barcelona/Sitges tickets. Is there anything specific that needs to happen?
Discussing with Henrique about his availability and expectations. Understanding Diogo’s schedule so that he can help Taahira and I will develop our ideas during sensemaking, if Henriques has to step away more.

How did the meeting go with Sovena?

Accountant Question for taxation?
