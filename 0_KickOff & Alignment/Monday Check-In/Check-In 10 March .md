> [!tt] 01 - Highlight of last week
> # What was your main highlight from last week's?
> (This could be a breakthrough, an interesting finding, or even a valuable lesson learned)


# TAAHIRA

-  finding good examples/case studies to support our research for the publish phase
- working on publish together!

# LAURA
Almost getting to the completion of our first phase. It was a fun challenge to get al lof the findings consolidated into a summarized form, especially as you start to rediscover some of your findings.

> [!tt] 02 - Findings and Patterns for team to know
> # Are there any emerging patterns or connections in your research that you think the team should know about?


# TAAHIRA

Personally last week & still week, i'm  thinking about this whole idea of 'culture capital' as i worked through gloal makes you trendy and woke, and i'm genuinely wondering what this means to me as a brown person/poc - bcos i wonder how much of this is performative or genuine. i guess the larger pattern or connection is how food or awareness of global foods has become a status symbol too. 
(Culture is the new capital)

And this makes me think a lot about the authenticity - a lot of the 'ethnic stores' are usually like run by migrants and sometimes have messy shopfronts or poor produce management, and as i imagined the futures of this place,  i wondered how we could retain that but still have more access to more people.

Affordability and what this means in context to the value of food to someone. What is perceived as wealth now is different. Food still plays a role, where you are dining and what you are dining on. Additionally, health and wellness as we have longer lives changes the diet, possibly to one of high precision. But then there is a whole section of a person’s income that needs to go to new expenses, luxury cars or name brand fashion, education, entertainment, travel. People did not travel as much and that is a huge luxury when you really think about it. 

  

‘Obesity remained a symbol of beauty worldwide.  There were famines during these centuries.  The Irish famine is one of the most famous. People died without sufficient food during this and other famines. Prosperity meant having enough money to buy or own food, and to eat well.  The wealthy ate in excess, assuring themselves status and “good health.”  Throughout the world, those who were leaders or rulers tended to have more fat on their bodies and withstood the famines more easily.’

> [!tt] 03 - Blockers
> # Did you encounter any unexpected challenges or roadblocks in your work process? What kind of support might help you address these in the future?


# TAAHIRA

- setting up a base language/structure of our future publish pages 
- deciding how much 'data' we want to include in publish section as well
- re-organising the way we work with notes/folders so that we can extract better info for publish* 
# LAURA
Not really. I was just working through how to consolidate all the findings. It wasn’t unexpected.
