Working on the loops with Laura, being able to translate insights ->narratives -> elements -> loops. We will on a roll at one point and did at several at one go

> [!tt] 02 - Findings and Patterns for team to know
> # Are there any emerging patterns or connections in your research that you think the team should know about?


# TAAHIRA

the connection between peru and hk were quite interesting - around 'grandmother's food/traditional food' as the north star of 'healthy' / what does that mean and to whom/which cultures (it assumes that )

# LAURA
We discussed flavors and taste perceptions at the lab on Friday. the varying degrees of perception people have for bitter, salty and sweet

> [!tt] 03 - Blockers
> # Did you encounter any unexpected challenges or roadblocks in your work process? What kind of support might help you address these in the future?


# TAAHIRA

- the use of AI on obsidian, it takes awhile and not sure how to master it yet 
- i fell ill which was horrible and i needed to recover slowly 
- transitioning between all our information insights/into narrative required us to have a holistic/strategic approach which i think we got to by thursday 
# LAURA
The loops can be challenging when you keep working at them for more than a couple hours, you get a little brain fry. Tried using Perplexity a bit last week . 

Just practicing getting the ideas out, quick and having a third party there to help Taahira and I when we have been in it to long. Additional input
