# **TAAHIRA

Meeting in person and doing the visit to Rhizoma + being able to discuss in person our rcommendations!

Combining my personal thoughts with perplexity deep research!

The cooperative. It was a nice group activity to cook together and then meet some of the community members to have an opportunity to discuss with them their own experiences. It would have been nice to talk to one of the original organizers to get a bigger picture idea as well.

# HENRIQUE
Team work from immersions, but it could have been more research driven

# TAAHIRA

Certainly a correlation we are finding between the element of surprise and positive food memories, the idea of how food + emotions can be 'manipulated' for 'capitalist/profit-driven gains' but it can also be used in other ways


# LAURA

Affordability. Riding on many public transport last week and seeing people eating. Thinking about the next group of consumers. Even on the bus there were some young germans, late 20’s and watching them eating packaged junk food.

Using deep research. Understanding how to utilize it by asking a question in the right way. It’s new for me and I need to explore how to use it best.
