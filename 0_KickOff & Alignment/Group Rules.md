# Henrique

- Please always be honest with me even if it hurts, my job is to keep learning, improving and it is not possible with honest information
- Please let me know if you have any pain, or if something is not happening as you expected, something that might drive you less motivated with the project. 
- I expect that we behave as a group, working in the most horizontal way as possible, but keeping in mind that there are parts who belong to the business or to a bigger vision. 
- the role of each one is to make this time unique and full of knowledge for everyone


***How I work***
- frontal - direct
- honest
- I like to be suprised and that I expect it
- I expect to delegate and that this is highly rewarded for everyone
- Be open for the unexpected - be flexible and care of everyone
