***Aspirations***
That we make this research and 5 months unique in our lives? 
How can we have fun?
How can we surprise each other and supporting each other to grow?
I would love to have such a relationship with this group, that at some point we dont consider it work anymore.


***Duties***
That everyone follows the group rules (times and expectations)
That everyone is dedicated
That everyone sees the importance of the topic
That we keep always challenging ourselves
