(From ChatGPT with additions from me) 

Migration and diaspora have profoundly influenced global culinary landscapes. Here are some notable examples:

### 1. [[African Diaspora in the Americas|African Diaspora in the Americas]]

During the transatlantic slave trade, enslaved Africans brought ingredients and cooking techniques to the Americas, leading to the creation of dishes like gumbo and jambalaya in the United States. These dishes blend African, European, and Native American culinary elements.

### 2. [[Fusion Cuisines|Fusion Cuisines]]

Indian communities migrating to Southeast Asia and the Caribbean have significantly influenced local cuisines. In Malaysia and Singapore, Indian flavors have melded with local tastes, resulting in unique dishes that reflect this blend.

E.g of dishes that are now not even found in India/China in the same way - Prawn Mee, Char Kway Teow, Roti Canai, [Paal Mee Siam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqvHx5DL3FAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqvHx5DL3FA) (these were all created with local ingredients with techniques from the place of origin)

Chinese immigrants to the United States adapted their traditional recipes to available ingredients and local preferences, leading to the development of American Chinese cuisine. Dishes like chop suey and General Tso's chicken, while not traditionally Chinese, became staples in American dining.
### 4. `Turkish Migration and the Global Kebab`

Turkish migrants have popularized the doner kebab worldwide. In Australia, for instance, the kebab has evolved into a unique "meal in a wrap," reflecting local tastes and ingredients.

### 5. [[Palestinian Diaspora and Culinary Preservation|Palestinian Diaspora and Culinary Preservation]]

Palestinian immigrants in the United States have used food to preserve and share their cultural heritage. Chefs like Reem Assil in Oakland, California, have established bakeries that serve traditional dishes, fostering community and educating others about Palestinian culture.
