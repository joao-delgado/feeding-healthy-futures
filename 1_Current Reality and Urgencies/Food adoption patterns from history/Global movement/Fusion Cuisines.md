The term fusion cuisine, added to the _[Oxford English Dictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary "Oxford English Dictionary")_ in 2002, is defined as "a style of cookery which blends ingredients and methods of preparation from different countries, regions, or ethnic groups; food cooked in this style."

It is particularly pertinent because of [[Diaspora & migration]] and [[Colonisations & Trade]]
