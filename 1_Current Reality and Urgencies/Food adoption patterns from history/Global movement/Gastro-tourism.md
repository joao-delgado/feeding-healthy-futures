Gastronomic tourism also known as culinary tours, food tourism is on an upward trend - It is estimated globally that more than a third of international tourist spending is spent on food (OECD, 2012; OMT & BCC, 2019) and contributes 31 % of total tourism jobs (UNWTO, 2022), even without counting its value chain. 

In modern day understanding of gastronomic tourism, there is a deeper connection, almost on an anthropolgic level to a tourist's interaction with places through food, integrating aspects of authenticity, culture, motivation, production, and economic factors.  Many businesses like Culinary BackStreets, focus solely on food tourism for this respect.

There is certainly a correlation between Memorable Gastronomic Experiences on well-being, intention to recommend and quality of life. This could mean, in simple terms that the more food tourists try on their holidays, the expansion of their [[Dietary Needs|diets]] and openess to [[Ethnic Cuisines]].

Furthermore, [[Feeding Healthy Futures/1_Current Reality and Urgencies/Hidden Desires /Food & Memory/Neurocognitive foundations in Food Memory .md|Food & Memory]] play a crucial role in culinary tours, because tourists tend to spend a lot of time eating and interacting with food on holidays. 

# On how gastronomic tourism can affect healthy food adoption (from perplexity)

A study by the International Journal of Gastronomy and Food Science found that 62% of culinary tourists adopt healthier eating habits after their travels[2](https://duffelbagspouse.com/healthy-culinary-travel/). This is likely due to several factors:

1. Exposure to fresh, local ingredients: Many destinations emphasize the use of fresh, locally sourced produce and lean meats, which can inspire tourists to incorporate similar ingredients into their diets at home[2](https://duffelbagspouse.com/healthy-culinary-travel/).
    
2. Nutritional diversity: Food tourism introduces travelers to a variety of nutrients and dietary practices from different cultures. For example, experiencing the traditional Japanese diet rich in seaweed and fish can expose tourists to foods high in omega-3 fatty acids[2](https://duffelbagspouse.com/healthy-culinary-travel/).
    
3. Mindful eating: Culinary tourism often encourages a more mindful approach to eating, as travelers take time to appreciate and understand the food they're consuming[2](https://duffelbagspouse.com/healthy-culinary-travel/).
    
4. Healthier food choices: Research from the World Food Travel Association indicates that 72% of food travelers reported eating healthier foods during their trips[2](https://duffelbagspouse.com/healthy-culinary-travel/).
    
5. Incorporation of new ingredients: 78% of culinary tourists try to incorporate new healthy ingredients into their diets after returning home, according to the Global Wellness Institute[2](https://duffelbagspouse.com/healthy-culinary-travel/).
