# Biological Feedback Mechanisms

Physiological responses to food, such as satiety signals and taste preferences, have historically guided food choices. Sweet and umami flavors signaled safe, energy-rich foods, while bitterness often indicated toxicity614. These innate preferences are evident in the global popularity of sugary snacks and savory dishes, despite modern awareness of their health risks614. Additionally, epigenetic studies suggest that generations exposed to famine developed thrifty genotypes, predisposing descendants to store calories efficiently—a trait mismatched with today’s food-abundant environments1415.
