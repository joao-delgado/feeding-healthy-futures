The word _coffee_ in English comes from the Dutch _koffie_, which came from the Ottoman Turkish _kahve_, ultimately derived from Arabic _qahwa_. This shows how coffee spread from Ethiopia/Yemen to the Islamic region, then to Europe through Ottoman and Dutch trade.

The origins of modern day coffee is split between what is known as modern day Ethiopia and modern day Yemen.
