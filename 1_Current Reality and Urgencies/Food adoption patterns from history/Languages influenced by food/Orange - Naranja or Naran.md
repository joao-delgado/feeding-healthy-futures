**"Orange" vs. "Naranja" vs. "Naran"**

- The English word _orange_ comes from Old French _orenge_, which came from Arabic _nāranj_, itself derived from Persian _nārang_ and ultimately from Sanskrit _nāraṅga_. This follows the path of citrus trade from India through the Middle East to Europe. 
- From Arabic, it entered Old French as "orenge" before becoming "orange" in Middle English.
