**Rice" vs. "Riz" vs. "Arroz" vs. "Oryza"**

- English _rice_, French _riz_, and Spanish _arroz_ all come from Latin _oryza_, which came from Greek _oryza_, ultimately from an older Sanskrit word _vrihi_. This reflects how rice traveled from South Asia through the Mediterranean trade routes.

Archaeologists excavating in India discovered rice which could be dated to 4530BC. However, the first recorded mention originates from China in 2800 BC. The Chinese emperor, Shen Nung, realised the importance of rice to his people and to honour the grain he established annual rice ceremonies to be held at sowing time, with the emperor scattering the first seeds.
