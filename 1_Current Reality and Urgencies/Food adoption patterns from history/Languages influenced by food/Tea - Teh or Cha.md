[[Crop Origins]]

The words used for tea across the world are very much shaped by where / who they were brought from 
![[teh cha map.png]]The words for _tea_—_te_ and _cha_—spread across the world along different trade routes, reflecting how tea was exported from China.

1. **"Cha" (茶)** – This pronunciation comes from Mandarin and Cantonese (_chá_) and spread mainly through land trade along [The Silk Road[. Countries influenced by this route include:
    
    - Persian _chay_ (چای)
    - Russian _chay_ (чай)
    - Turkish _çay_
    - Arabic _shay_ (شاي)
    - Hindi _chai_ (चाय)
    
2. **"Te" (茶)** – This pronunciation comes from the **Min Nan (Hokkien)** Chinese dialect spoken in Fujian, a key region for early tea trade. The Dutch, who controlled maritime trade in the 17th century, spread this version through sea routes, influencing:
    
    - English _tea_
    - French _thé_
    - Spanish _té_
    - German _Tee_
    - Italian _tè_

In short, if a country got tea via **land routes [The Silk Road]**, they say _cha_, while those that got it through **sea trade (Dutch merchants)** use _te_.
