According to TCM theory, food therapy works by balancing the Yin and Yang within the body and aligning an individual's diet with their unique constitution and health condition. 

Food, in Chinese medical terms, is classified based on its energy, taste, and effect on the body. There are five key flavours—sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and pungent—each associated with a different Zangfu or function within the body.
