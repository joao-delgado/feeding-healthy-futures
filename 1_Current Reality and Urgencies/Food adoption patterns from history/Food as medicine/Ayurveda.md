Ayurveda, a traditional system medicine that originated over three millennia ago in the South Asian region, offers extensive insights about food and health based on certain unique conceptual as well as theoretical positions. Health is defined as a state of equilibrium with one’s self (_svasthya_) but which is inextricably linked to the environment. 

Ayurvedic principles, such as the _tridosa_ (three humors) theory, provide the relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm that can be applied in day-to-day practice.
