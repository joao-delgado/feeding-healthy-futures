# Scarcity and Social Stratification
Throughout history, food access has been stratified by class and wealth. In medieval Europe, elites consumed meat and spices as status symbols, while peasants relied on grains and legumes[4](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0cdd26872a7089e76736874caffdaeedd841264a)[10](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0adde4731cb3e9fd41956f9c1dcdde396a01663). This dichotomy persists in modern food deserts, where low-income communities face limited access to fresh produce[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7663776/)[17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20205042/). Economic instability exacerbates these patterns, as evidenced by increased consumption of calorie-dense foods during economic crises—a behavior rooted in the instinct to prioritize energy storage during perceived scarcity[14](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23302296/)[17](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20205042/).

# Trade and Globalization
The Columbian Exchange (15th–17th centuries) revolutionized global diets by introducing crops like potatoes, tomatoes, and maize to Europe and Asia[10](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0adde4731cb3e9fd41956f9c1dcdde396a01663). Similarly, the spice trade shaped culinary practices, embedding foreign ingredients into national cuisines (e.g., chili peppers in Indian food)[10](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0adde4731cb3e9fd41956f9c1dcdde396a01663). Today, globalization facilitates the spread of ultra-processed foods, creating homogenous dietary patterns that coexist with localized traditions[10](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b0adde4731cb3e9fd41956f9c1dcdde396a01663)[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7663776/).
