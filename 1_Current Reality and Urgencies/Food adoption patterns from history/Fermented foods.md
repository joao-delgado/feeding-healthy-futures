Evidence of a fermented alcoholic beverage made from fruit, honey, and rice found in Neolithic China dates back to 7000-6600 BCE. Wine-making dates to around 6000 BCE in Georgia, in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. There is also strong evidence that people were fermenting beverages in Babylon around 3000 BCE.

Even before fermented alcoholic beverages were developed, humans were fermenting a type of food with notoriously poor holding qualities – dairy. Particularly, the milk of camels, goats, sheep, and cattle was naturally fermented as far back as 10,000 BCE. It’s likely that the fermentation occurred spontaneously, rather than intentionally, due to naturally existing microflora present in the milk. The subtropical climate where this dairy fermentation took place likely played a large role in its occurrence, as thermophilic lactic acid fermentation favors the heat of this climate. It has been suggested that the first yogurts were produced in goat bags draped over the backs of camels in the heat of North Africa, where temperatures around 110°F during the day made ideal conditions for fermentation to occur.
