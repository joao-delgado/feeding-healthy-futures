Bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia), also called ervil, is a Neolithic leguminous grain crop which is found in the Mediterranean region. The crop is also known as rovi in Greek, gavdaneh in Persian, yero in Spanish, bur√ßak Turkish, and kersannah in Arabic. The grain's nutritional value for ruminant cattle has guaranteed its continued cultivation in Spain, Turkey, and Morocco. Since Bitter vetch is easy to harvest and cultivate it can be easily grown on shallow alkaline soils. When the grain splits it looks like red lentils. For the grain to be consumed by humans, the seeds are removed via leaching by use of boiling water to remove the bitterness. Bitter vetch is a great grain to be used as a feed concentrate for both cattle and sheep. Since the beginning of agriculture, the crop has been strongly considered as an excellent component for adding nutritional value to bulk feeds. The plant was first grown about 9,500 years ago around the near east.
