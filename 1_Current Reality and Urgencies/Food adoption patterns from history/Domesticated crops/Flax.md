 Flax is both a fiber and food crop which is cultivated in different areas of the world where climates are cooler. Western countries make textile from flax known as linen which is traditionally used to make undergarments, table linen, and bed sheets. Flax is also used to produce oil called linseed oil.

Flax is also a good 'meat alternative' - seen for its ability to make 'the runny texture' of eggs.
