[[Crop Origins]]
[[Domesticated crops]]

Emmer wheat is also known as hulled wheat or farro in Italy. Emmer wheat exists in both wild and domesticated species. 

The primary difference between the wild and the domesticated species is that the seeds of domesticated emmer do not burst when ripe like in the wild emmer wheat species but rather stays intact which makes harvesting an easier task. 

**Emmer wheat was also among the first crops to be domesticated in the Western Asia region.** The crop was widely cultivated, but at present, its cultivation is restricted in the mountainous region of Asia and Europe. The emmer wheat was collected by hunters and gatherers for thousands of years before they were domesticated in about 10,000 to 9,400 years ago.
