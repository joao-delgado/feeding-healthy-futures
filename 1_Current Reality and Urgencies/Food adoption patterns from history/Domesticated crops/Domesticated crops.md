Neolithic founder crops which are also known as primary domesticates consist of eight species of plants that were first domesticated by the early Holocene era (**the last 11,700 years* of the Earth's history**).

The domestication was carried out by farming communities located in the crescent-shaped fertile region of southwest Asia known as the Fertile Crescent. The region is also responsible for the establishment of systematic agriculture in India, North Africa, Persia, the Middle East and Europe. Flax, three kinds of cereal, and four types of pulses were the eight first crops to be domesticated by humankind.
