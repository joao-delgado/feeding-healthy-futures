Greenwashing, often referred to as eco-washing, eco-bleaching, greenwashing, or green image washing, is the practice of companies or organizations using deceptive advertising to boost the perceived overall advantages of their products, generally to boost the apparent appeal and sustainability of their product to consumers. 

- Foodcycler (2021) reported that the industry that suffered the most greenwashing practices was the food sector. This is also the result of the up to 500% increase in the popularity of veganism in less than 10 years as well as consumersâ€™ growing interest in environmentally friendly products
