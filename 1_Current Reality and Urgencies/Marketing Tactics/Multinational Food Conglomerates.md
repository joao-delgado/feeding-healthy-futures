# Multinational Food Company Acquisition 
Multinationals understand better than anyone the need to remain relevant and to do that purchase smaller companies (in any industry) to diversify their brands and capture more customers across demographics.

Often, general consumers are unaware that multinationals like Nestle, Coco-Cola, Unilever, General Mills etc own these smaller brands. Over the last couple of decades, companies producing natural, healthy, organic, etc have been growing in popularity. Multinationals purchase these companies because they are highly regarded by consumers for their health and/or sustainability standards. One US example is Annie's being bought out by General Mills. General Mills acquired Annie's on September 8, 2014, for $820 million

Buying Organic, [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2014/09/08/buying-organic-general-mills-swallows-annies-for-820-million/)
> Annie's has grown from a small player in the food business (founded in 1989) to one that had $204 million in food sales in the last fiscal year on over 145 products across 35,000 retail locations. Its rise has corresponded with the huge growth in consumer demand for organic food. Annie's claims its products are made without artificial flavors, synthetic colors, or preservatives used in many other conventional packaged foods -- like the ones General Mills is known for.
> "This acquisition will significantly expand our presence in the U.S. branded organic and natural foods industry, where sales have been growing at a 12 percent compound rate over the last 10 years.  Annie's competes in a number of attractive food categories, with particular strength in convenient meals and snacks---two of General Mills' priority platforms," General Mills COO for US Retail Jeff Harmening said in a statement.

> What’s Included in the Consumer Goods Sector
> The sector encompasses everything from toiletries and cosmetics to food, beverages, and various household items. It’s traditionally segmented into durable goods, including long-lasting items like home furnishings, and nondurable goods, such as food and personal care products. The latter category, often referred to as Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), is characterized by products that have a quick turnover rate and are sold at relatively low prices. These include everyday items like packaged foods, beverages, and toiletries, all forming an essential part of consumer life.
> FMCGs, in particular, have witnessed evolving consumer purchasing behaviors, especially in rural areas where there’s a noticeable shift towards local buying, reflecting broader economic patterns and the demand for such goods. The sector’s companies range from local manufacturers to global giants like [Nestlé](https://quartr.com/companies/nestl-s-a_12094), [Procter & Gamble](https://quartr.com/companies/the-procter-gamble-company_6491), and [Unilever](https://quartr.com/companies/unilever-plc_5669), which dominate the market through extensive distribution networks, strong brands, and massive product portfolios.
> And going forward, the future will likely see more personalization in products, integration of AI and technology, and a shift towards eco-friendly practices.These behemoths of commerce, owning an array of brands that populate our shelves, not only shape our daily choices but also echo the broader economic and societal trends.

## Regenerative 
General Mills is one of several big companies investing in regenerative agriculture. Will it reverse climate change or just help sell more products? [Civil Eats ](https://civileats.com/2019/10/29/big-food-is-betting-on-regenerative-agriculture-to-thwart-climate-change/)
> General Mills, the packaged food giant, is one of several Big Food corporations jumping on the regenerative agriculture bandwagon, escalating the buzz around the idea that capturing carbon in the soil could reverse climate change. The company took the lead when it [announced this spring](https://www.generalmills.com/en/News/NewsReleases/Library/2019/March/Regen-Ag) that it would apply regenerative agriculture to 1 million acres by 2030—about a quarter of the land from which it sources ingredients in North America.
> Danone, Kellogg, Nestlé, and a dozen other companies are not far behind. At the recent United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York City, [they announced](https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-Land-Water/News/Nineteen-leading-companies-join-forces-to-step-up-alternative-farming-practices-and-protect-biodiversity-for-the-benefit-of-planet-and-people) the [One Planet Business for Biodiversity](https://op2b.org/) (OP2B) coalition to advance regenerative agriculture, rebuild biodiversity, and eliminate deforestation. And Land O’Lakes, the dairy and animal feed behemoth, is also touting its [soil conservation efforts](https://www.landolakessustain.com/about-us/), including a new initiative to help bolster [sustainability on 1.5 million acres of U.S.-grown corn](https://www.landolakesinc.com/Press/News/Corn-Sustainability-Initiative).
