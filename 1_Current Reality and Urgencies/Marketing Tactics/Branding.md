Branding is a large umbrella of ideas linked to typography, language used, colours and design. This note is a brief examination of these tendencies in their influence these elements have on food. Since we accept that food by itself is neutral, we can then unpack how certain ways in which these ideas are twisted to make them 'palatable' for certain audiences

# LANGUAGE

Typically, food targeted at men use words like 'mega', 'strong' while those used at women are more 'healthy'.   It also appears to be socially accepted for men to have the red meat and meat-heavy option, while women are expected to have the dainty salad. 

There is an illusion of the 'small appetite' of the woman as compared to that of a man, in closely tied to social constructs around a woman's body (ie to be slim and sexy)

# COLOURS

In the recent years, there has been an upward trend towards soft pastel hues or earth-toned colours like greens, browns, muted yellows, etc. The focus on 'instamgrability' of food has affected how food is presented.

Similarly, healthy food is often seen as feminine.
