# Single Serve Takeaway Origins 

The Chinese Takeout Container Is Uniquely American, [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/magazine/the-chinese-takeout-container-is-uniquely-american.html)
> The Chinese-takeout container, with its Japanese-influenced origami folds, is a uniquely American invention. On Nov. 13, 1894, in Chicago, the inventor Frederick Weeks Wilcox patented a version of what he called a “paper pail,” which was a single piece of paper, creased into segments and folded into a (more or less) leakproof container secured with a dainty wire handle on top. The supportive folds on the outside, fastened with that same wire, created a flat interior surface over which food could slide smoothly onto a plate. (Oyster pails: These were originally used to transport oysters and had a similar folded construction.)

Take Out Delivery Food History, [Time](https://time.com/4291197/take-out-delivery-food-history/)
Pizza 
> By 1944, restaurants in New York City offered pizza that could be “ordered to take home,” which were “packed, piping hot, in special boxes for that purpose.” A few years later, Los Angeles would again prove to be on top of the world’s delivery needs, when a pizza joint named [Casa D’Amore](https://www.milkman.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/rb01098-inside1.jpg) began offering what is thought to be one of the first examples of free delivery. (This was, of course, only if eaters met the $2.50 minimum order.)
