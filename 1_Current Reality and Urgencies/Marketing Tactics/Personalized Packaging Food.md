# Power of Packaging and Presentation 

Psychology of Unwrapping Something, like it is special for you, a gift. It's the perfect way to get hit the gratification center of the human brain.

Stop Playing With My Kids' Food,[ Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/food-junkie/201305/stop-playing-with-my-kids-food)
> It’s [classical conditioning](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/behaviorism "Psychology Today looks at classical conditioning") in its simplest form: the toy is the unconditioned stimulus, which kids want without any training, the Happy Meal is the neutral stimulus, which kids learn to associate with the toy over time, and thus the food becomes a conditioned stimulus. It doesn’t hurt that the contents of the Happy Meal also are super palatable and can be reinforcing on their own.

[The complicated history of McDonald’s Happy Meal ](https://digitaledition.chicagotribune.com/tribune/article_popover.aspx?guid=8b176b85-2740-4d43-b199-0f9acecd40bd#:~:text=During%20the%20summer%20of%201979,a%20soft%20drink%20and%20cookies.)
> Because the first Happy Meals initially included “such chintzy toys,” Seidelman said the advertising took pains to avoiding revealing “the prizes.”But eventually, Barbie, Hot Wheels, Disney, Hello Kitty, Transformers — a Happy Meal became a vehicle for showcasing cultural franchises as shamelessly as any celebrity appearing on a late-night talk show.

The Happy Meal -  The summer of 1979, McDonald’s premiered the Happy Meal nationally.

## The TRENDS 2025 

2025 Hospitality Trends Report,[AF&Co 2025 Trends Report](https://www.afandco.com/whats-trending/)
Take-Out Boxes That Stand Out
> Unique, branded to-go packaging entices customers to share their meal on social (a built-in marketing boost). Plus with containers this cool, one could be proud to serve them with guests in real life.
> Additionally, with 52% of those ordering delivery eating it on their sofa, and another 12% eating it in bed, packaging that keeps everything in its rightful place—and helps ensure items maintain their quality—enhances the overall customer experience. (All data cited is from DoorDash’s 2024 Restaurant & Alcohol Online Ordering Trends report.)

How Will We Eat in 2025? 9 Predictions to Chew On, [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/dining/food-eating-predictions-2025.html)
Takeout as Art
> As the world of takeout and delivery continues to expand, so do the containers it comes in. Restaurants will up their game with thoughtful, Instagrammable packaging that lends itself to unboxing videos and can serve as a fun focal point for entertaining at home — like the [$100 chicken and caviar box](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/style/us-open-chicken-nuggets.html) sold this year at the U.S. Open, and the three-tiered [Triple Treat Box](https://www.pizzahut.com/c/content/triple-treat-box) from Pizza Hut. “The packaging is part of the food experience that gets overlooked,” said Mr. Freeman of AF & Co.

## Insights
So while you can see that a customized box can be high end in the case of chicken nuggets for the US Open, it then gets reinterpreted for a more affordable idea, such as the triple tier Pizza Hut Pizza box (Three pizzas)


## Examples
At the U.S. Open, a Quest for $100 Chicken Nuggets,[ NY Times ](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/09/style/us-open-chicken-nuggets.html)
> Like so many coveted items, the nuggets became a hot commodity over the two-week tournament — and the subject of [some heated debate](https://www.tiktok.com/@foodnetwork/video/7409375187445108014) online — in part because of their exorbitant price and their air of exclusivity. Created by the team at [Coqodaq](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/dining/restaurant-review-coqodaq.html) (a luxe Manhattan fried chicken restaurant that itself can be famously hard to book), the nuggets were at a stall open only to tennis fans with a ticket for the club level, home to the suites at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
>  A single unadorned nugget could be had for as little as $4.25 (if you agreed to buy at least eight), while both the 24 Karat Edition nuggets, which came with Petrossian caviar and a dot of crème fraîche, and the Black Gold Edition nuggets, which were covered in black truffles and truffle mayo, were $16.67 per nugget.
