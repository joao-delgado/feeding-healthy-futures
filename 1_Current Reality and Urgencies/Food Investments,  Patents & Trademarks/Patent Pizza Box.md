Pizza Box, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box)
> The first patent for a pizza box made of [corrugated fiberboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugated_fiberboard "Corrugated fiberboard") was applied in 1963 and it already displayed the characteristics of today's pizza packaging: plane blanks, foldability without need of adhesive, stackability and ventilation slots.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-USP3163344-3) The combination of such slots along with water vapour absorbing materials ([absorption agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_of_water "Absorption of water")) prevented the humidity build-ups that characterized traditional transport packaging.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-USP3163344-3) It is assumed by brand historians(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-:0-4) that the pizza box was invented by [Domino's Pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino%27s_Pizza "Domino's Pizza"), even if they did not file a [patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent "Patent") application.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-mad-2) Until 1988, this chain employed a type of packaging whose front side was not directly connected to the lateral sides,(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-CorrellHistory-5) but rather the flaps fixed to the lateral sides were folded inward under the lid. This design is also known as "Chicago folding"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-CorrellHistory-5) Domino's was the first pizza producer which employed pizza boxes on a large scale and in this way expanded its delivery range beyond the area immediately close to the pizzeria.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-:0-4) Towards the end of the 1960s, the delivery service was further developed thanks to the introduction of heat-insulating bags.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_box#cite_note-USP3428103-6)\>)
