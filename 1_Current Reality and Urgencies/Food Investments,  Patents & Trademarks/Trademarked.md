Trademarking food is a bit of a tricky area. You can't actually trademark the _food itself_ – like, you can't trademark the concept of a hamburger. However, you can trademark things related to the food that identify your specific brand. Here's a breakdown of the rules around trademarked foods:  

**What you CAN trademark:**

- **Brand names:** This is the most common. Think "Coca-Cola," "Lay's," or "Big Mac." These names are unique identifiers for your product.
- **Logos:** Distinctive logos, like the golden arches of McDonald's or the Nike swoosh on a line of protein bars, can be trademarked.  
    
- **Packaging:** The unique design of your packaging, like the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle or the distinct pattern on a box of Kellogg's cereal, can be protected.  
    
- **Slogans:** Catchy phrases used in your marketing, like "I'm lovin' it" or "Just do it," can be trademarked.  
    

**What you CANNOT trademark:**

- **Generic terms:** You can't trademark words that are commonly used to describe a type of food, like "pizza," "coffee," or "chocolate."  
    
- **Descriptive terms:** You generally can't trademark words that simply describe your product, like "cheesy pizza" or "strong coffee."
- **The food itself:** You can't trademark the recipe or the idea of a specific food item. Anyone can make a hamburger, but only McDonald's can call theirs a "Big Mac."  
    

**Why trademark food?**

- **Brand recognition:** Trademarks help consumers identify and distinguish your products from those of your competitors.  
    
- **Protection against copycats:** Trademarks prevent others from using your brand name, logo, or packaging to sell similar products.  
    
- **Building brand loyalty:** Trademarks help you build brand loyalty and trust with consumers.
