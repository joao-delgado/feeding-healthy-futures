Milka's distinctive purple color is indeed trademarked, and there's an interesting story behind it.

The purple color (specifically Pantone 2685C) has been Milka's signature since 1901 when it was introduced by the Swiss chocolate company Suchard. The distinctive lilac/purple packaging has become strongly associated with the Milka brand over more than a century of consistent use.

Milka's parent company, MondelÄ“z International (formerly Kraft Foods), trademarked the purple color to protect their brand identity for several key reasons:

1. Brand recognition - The purple color creates instant recognition among consumers, even from a distance on store shelves
2. Market differentiation - It distinguishes Milka from competitors in the crowded chocolate market
3. Brand equity - After decades of marketing and association, the color itself carries significant commercial value

While colors aren't typically eligible for trademark protection on their own, they can be trademarked when they acquire "secondary meaning" - when consumers strongly associate that color with a specific brand in a particular market category. Milka's purple is a perfect example of this, as consumers across Europe and globally now associate this specific shade of purple with Milka chocolate.

This is similar to other famous color trademarks like Tiffany's blue, UPS brown, or T-Mobile's magenta. In each case, the companies have successfully demonstrated that these colors serve as source identifiers in their respective markets.
