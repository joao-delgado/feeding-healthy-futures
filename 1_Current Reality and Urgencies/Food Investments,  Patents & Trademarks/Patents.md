Patents protect any new, useful, and nonobvious process, machine, manufacture, or composition. While patents could seem an ideal tool to protect any innovative recipe, manufacturing process, or packaging, the threshold for the novelty and nonobviousness criteria is so high that patents remain relatively underused in the food business. This is all the more true in an industry in which entrepreneurs are also limited by essential food safety considerations that may curb their freedom in practice.  
  
According to the U.S. Supreme Court, to claim protection in food products, “_an applicant must establish a coaction or cooperative relationship between the selected ingredients which produces a new, unexpected, and useful function.” As a result, “new recipes or formulas for cooking food, which involve the addition or elimination of common ingredients, or for treating them in ways which differ from the former practice, do not amount to invention merely because no one else ever did [it]._”[[4](https://www.food-safety.com/articles/6872-intellectual-property-protection-in-the-food-industry#References)]  
  
This strict position has discouraged many in the industry from applying for patent protection.

More exceptionally, this tool has also been used to protect new foods, such as the patent obtained by chef Ferran Adria on his Olive Oil Caviar.
