In the U.S., design patents, a subset of patent law, provide protection to original, nonfunctional, and useful products or packaging. A design patent lasts up to 20 years and remains a good enforcement tool against infringers.  
  
Similar protections exist in other countries, such as the protection offered by registered community design (RCD) or unregistered community design (UCD) in Europe. To be valid, RCDs and UCDs must be novel and have individual character. RCDs and UCDs are given 5 years of protection and are renewable up to 25 years.  
  
While design patents and RCDs offer a good protection option for product or packaging shape, the duration of their protection is limited in time and their validity is often challenged. When this protection is available, businesses will therefore often opt, instead, for a 3-D trademark or trade dress.
