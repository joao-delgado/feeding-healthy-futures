Simply put, trade dress protects the overall look and feel of a product, as long as its owner can show that the consumer will immediately associate this look and feel with their brand. Based on this, Pepperidge Farm was able to obtain trade dress protection on its famous Goldfish crackers, Coca-Cola on its famous Coca-Cola bottle, and Hard Rock Cafe on their buildings.

However, such protection may not be available for every brand, as trade dress protection requires a fairly high standard of originality, substantial marketing investment, and a certain degree of notoriety.[[3](https://www.food-safety.com/articles/6872-intellectual-property-protection-in-the-food-industry#References)]
