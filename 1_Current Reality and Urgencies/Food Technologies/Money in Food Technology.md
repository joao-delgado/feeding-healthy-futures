It is expected to be worth USD 280 billion in 2026. If we can explore these numbers further, I believe we could also connect this note with the note on Sustainable Food Packaging Advantages. 


The global market for [[Plant-Based Proteins  ]] (Plant based meats specifically) alternatives reached $5.3 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow to $33.3 billion by 2031, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 20.5%[4](https://leverfoundation.org/beyond-the-trend-the-history-of-plant-based-meat/). This dramatic market expansion indicates that plant-based proteins have moved from niche products to mainstream alternatives. In Asia alone, intellectual property related to plant-based meat has more than tripled over a decade, increasing from 2,388 patents in 2012 to 7,126 in 2022[4](https://leverfoundation.org/beyond-the-trend-the-history-of-plant-based-meat/). This surge in innovation underscores the growing commercial and scientific investment in plant protein development.
