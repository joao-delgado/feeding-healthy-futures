Many articles on evolutionary psychology will tell us that: 

- **Food choices are based on evolved preferences** – Humans, like rats, choose foods not just for nutrition but due to innate preferences for sweetness and fatty textures.
- **Learning plays a role in diet** – Social learning and taste aversions shape food choices over time, influencing cultural food traditions [Traditions and Rituals Influence].
- **Cultural evolution engages genetic predispositions** – Staples like corn, milk, and meat became dietary norms because they align with natural human preferences for fat and sweetness. [Crops]
- **Disgust evolved from food avoidance** – The emotion of disgust originally helped humans avoid harmful foods but later extended to other aspects of life.
- **Food choice is key in evolutionary psychology** – Understanding eating habits is crucial because food shapes human behavior, traditions, and societal norms.
