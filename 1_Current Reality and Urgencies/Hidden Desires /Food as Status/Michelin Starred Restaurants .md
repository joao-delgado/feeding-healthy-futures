What started in 1926 by a car company, Michelin has now created a boom of more than 40,000 establishments in over 24 territories across three continents. 

This movement of Michelin-star restaurants has interconnected food, tourism and driving, and created special niches for Ã©ating out.

Prestige of [[Eating Out]]
The prestige associated with Michelin stars has elevated dining out to a form of cultural consumption, where patrons seek not only sustenance but also social status and unique experiences. This phenomenon is evident in both the UK and Germany, countries without a deep-rooted tradition of haute cuisine, yet they have seen a substantial rise in Michelin-starred establishments since the early 1980s. This growth reflects a societal shift towards valuing culinary artistry and innovation, positioning dining at such venues as a marker of social distinction.
