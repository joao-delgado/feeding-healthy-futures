##  [Food is the New Luxury ](https://nonggol-darapati.medium.com/food-is-the-new-luxury-and-ultimate-status-symbol-5937e1da54c7#:~:text=Lately%2C%20though%2C%20food%20has%20gained,the%20IT%20item%20to%20have.)

> With a global recession looming, people are less likely to spend on high-end accessories, but a premium snack or coffee is a smaller indulgence they might splurge on. According to Deloitte, consumers are increasingly spending on these “little luxuries,” from specialty coffee to gourmet snacks.
> With the rise of inflation and shrinkflation, today, people often prefer to spend their money on little treats and experiences that are considered more affordable and yet bring satisfaction.

> **Little Luxuries**
> TikTok creators have brought “Little Treat Culture” into the zeitgeist, and we’re on board. We know firsthand the power of a treat, like an impulse macaron buy or a fizzy, functional and flavor-forward bev. Brands are getting in on the trend by considering both cost and format — like individual serving packages that add joy without breaking a budget, and outlets like [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/whole-foods-cheap-summer-groceries-2023-23548135) regularly dish out lists of “Little Luxuries” found for $10 or less.

A little treat is exactly what it sounds like — a small luxury, typically under $15, that serves as either a reward or a consolation prize for maneuvering through the trials and tribulations of simply existing in contemporary society. The phrase really caught on during the pandemic, when we were mostly homebound, deeply anxious and largely powerless.
