# Eating-Out 
Over the last couple of decades, we have exchanged home-cooked meals for more eating out. Dining out, which was often done for celebratory moments, became more commonplace just as a weekly meal or meals. With the development of more fast-casual restaurants, general interest in trying new cuisines, more modern lifestyles with less time dedicated to cooking and declining interest in cooking, eating has changed.
