# Emotional Eating

**Emotional eating**, also known as **stress eating** and **emotional overeating**,(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_eating#cite_note-1) is defined as the "propensity to eat in response to positive and negative emotions".(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_eating#cite_note-2) While the term commonly refers to eating as a means of coping with negative emotions, it sometimes includes eating for positive emotions, such as overeating when celebrating an event or to enhance an already good mood. 

## Academic theories around emotional eating

- The Kaplan and Kaplan psychosomatic theory of obesity Kaplan and Kaplan (1957) proposed that obese people overeat when anxious and eating reduces this anxiety.

- Bruch (1973) connected overeating to faulty hunger awareness. This theory proposes that the experience of ‘hunger’ is not innate but learning is necessary for its organization into recognizable patterns. [[Confusion on healthy eating, various ideas on what good nutrition is]]
