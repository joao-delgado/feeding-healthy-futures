# Food Politics 


> [!note] > Diogo's comment
> In my opinion, this topic is very important to our research.
> 
> As discussed in some books, such as _Food Politics_ and [Buy.ology](https://www.amazon.com/Buyology-Truth-Lies-About-Why/dp/0385523890), the food industry is not so different from others, like the pharmaceutical industry. 
> 
> Exploring this topic could be valuable because many of the food patterns that exist today are heavily influenced by food politics. We briefly discussed this in our first meeting, using the example of Halal and Kosher certifications.
> 
> I also believe that we can correlate this with the  [[Food Labeling]] ("labeling dependency") that we talked about.


# Food Politics: How the Food Industry Influences Nutrition and Health
[Marion Nestle ](https://www.foodpolitics.com/food-politics-how-the-food-industry-influences-nutrition-and-health/)
> Like manufacturing cigarettes or building weapons, making food is big business. Food companies in 2000 generated nearly $900 billion in sales. They have stakeholders to please, shareholders to satisfy, and government regulations to deal with. It is nevertheless shocking to learn precisely **how food companies lobby officials, co-opt experts, and expand sales by marketing to children, members of minority groups, and people in developing countries.** We learn that the food industry plays politics as well as or better than other industries, not least because so much of its activity takes place outside the public view.
> When it comes to the mass production and consumption of food, strategic decisions are **driven by economics**--not science, not common sense, and certainly not health. No wonder most of us are thoroughly confused about what to eat to stay healthy.
