# Food Trends Created by Influencers 

Well-known food and wine professionals have evolved over the years from celebrity status to influencers. Starting around the mid-90s, celebrity chefs were recognized primarily for their stage presence and personalities, more relatable to entertainers. Emeril Lagasse, Gordon Ramsay, Guy Fieri, and Bobby Flay, were Food Network-marketed TV stars who provided elevated excitement to audiences and paved the way for the marketability of a chef’s identity. That is not to say this still doesn’t exist, Bottle Rock in Napa Valley has readapted this idea with live food presentations on the [William Sonoma-sponsored culinary stage](https://www.bottlerocknapavalley.com/culinary-stage-lineup/). Entertainment celebrities (singers, actors) join with culinary celebrities who intermingled within the main musical performances, such as a cultural combination of Martha Stewart with Snoop Dog. And now new forms of media are creating TikTok, Instagram and YouTube celebrities, like Nick DiGiovanni, Pierce Abernathy, SuperVinoBros. Individuals that build their audiences through social media. All this is to say is that popular chefs can carry a huge level of influence over the public and culinary-related trends or products.

There is a new style of influencer chef, it is food and wine professionals who are admired for their ethos. This is especially true for those who have a more laissez-faire form of cooking or wine education which appeals to younger generations. A big influence came from Bon Appetit and its YouTube channel which created publicly accessible videos inside the test kitchen, sometimes incorporating celebrity guests. Individuals now identify more with how the professional is represented in a cultural context, the way they might operate their business, what projects they focus on, their brand, and whom they align themselves with, their collaborators. So, some consumers/individuals identify with the values, philanthropic and/or personal style rather than a well-curated entertainment factor of a personality. It is sometimes the imperfectness and jovial nature of a person that can be appealing. Some interesting influencers include individuals like David Zilber, Jose Andres, Anthony Bourdain, Brad Leone, André Mack and Sandor Katz. All with very different backgrounds and personalities, contributing something more personalized to their audiences, with very exploratory and curious content. They hold a level of respect and admiration from their followers. A great example of this influence in business terms is the Finish app, [World of Mouth](https://www.worldofmouth.app/experts) which uses experts, highly regarded international chefs to provide restaurant recommendations in major cities around the world and podcast content.

## Secondary Trends

[Globalisation of food trends] 
@righteousfoods (Jackie) wrote a brilliant article on how the future of  restaurant c ulture is not just about looking for what is 'authentic' to a place but also who/what makes up the place.  For an e.g, there is a HUGE chinese population in Prado, Italy that has created a boom of Chinese restaurants. could eating chinese food in italy not be a 'gastro-faux paux' anymore?
