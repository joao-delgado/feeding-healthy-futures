> The food industry has always tried to influence consumer buying decisions through various tactics, including marketing, product placement, pricing strategies, and the use of addictive substances like sugar. If we take this "manipulation" to a global scale, we are talking about influencing—and even creating—new food patterns. 
> 
> The book [Buyology](https://www.amazon.com/Buyology-Truth-Lies-About-Why/dp/0385523890) by Martin Lindstrom provides great examples of how companies use neuromarketing to make products more appealing—for example, the color and design of packaging, as well as the color of eggshells and yolks. 
> 
> Once again, food labeling is everywhere, and sometimes not with the best intentions. Some companies take advantage of labels such as “natural,” “organic,” or “low-fat” to increase their sales, even when their products contain high sugar levels (e.g., [Vitaminwater](https://www.supplysidesj.com/litigation/judge-approves-settlement-of-coca-cola-vitaminwater-lawsuit) was sued for misleading consumers by marketing itself as a health drink). 
> 
> Last but not least, we have the use of sugar and other addictive ingredients. The food industry is an expert at using these ingredients to enhance cravings. A great book on this topic is [Salt Sugar Fat](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Sugar-Fat-Giants-Hooked/dp/0812982193) by Michael Moss, which reveals how food scientists at companies like Nestlé and Kraft optimize these ingredients to make products addictive.

Research suggests we're more likely to engage with photos of fast food, says Ethan Pancer, professor of marketing at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. This is particularly true of saturated fat, because it makes us feel good by [releasing dopamine and stimulating pleasure centres](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/25078/) in the brain. [Humans are biologically primed to seek out calorie-dense food](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72570-x) – an ability that helped our ancestors survive when they foraged for food.****

"Evolutionary psychology has found that people feel happy when they simply see these foods, and thus engage with it more," he says.

"There's a lot of individual difference in terms of how we respond to social media images, in terms of our own biological and psychological processes," she says. Some people have a higher reward response to food cues, for example, where the brain sends out pleasure signals after seeing certain foods, Atkinson says. These people are more likely to respond to food cues no matter where they see them.
