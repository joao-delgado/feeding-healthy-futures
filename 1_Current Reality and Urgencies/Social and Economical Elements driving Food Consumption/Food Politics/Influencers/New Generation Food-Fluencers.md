The new generation of food influencers are people who started out as 'foodie' bloggers or content creators on Instagram who styled food, shared food content or showed how food was made.

Unlike those mentioned in [[Influencers in Food|Influencers in Food]]

Many influencers who promote food content do not have an established food or nutrition background.Â **Whilst enthusiastic, they may not fully understand the impact of what they are promoting to impressionable minds and the repercussions that may have over the long term.** 


Some key types of food influencers nowadays (based on my perception)

1. Those who take more 'aesthetic meals' of what they eat and where to go to eat 
2. Those who teach people how to cook '30 minutes meals' or 'one pan meals'
3. Those who shared heritage food / older recipes from specific cultures 
4. Those who are wellness influencers or suggest for healthy/clean meals etc (related to specific diet [Allergiies & Dietary restrictions])
5. Those who perform certain kinds of performative eating, like in Korea, Mukbang is the process of eating excessive amounts of food in front of the camera
