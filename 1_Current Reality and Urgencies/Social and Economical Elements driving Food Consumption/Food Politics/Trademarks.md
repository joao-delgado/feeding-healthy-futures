[Momofuku](https://momofuku.com/), the food empire founded by celebrity chef David Chang, is attempting to seize control of the market – or at least the name. The company has sent cease-and-desist letters to companies using the term “chili crunch” and “chile crunch” on their condiment labels and is trying to trademark “chili crunch” with the [US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)](https://www.uspto.gov/). 

This disrupts small and medium 'home-based businesses' that have been using this title, but more problematically creates monopolies in the food industry.
