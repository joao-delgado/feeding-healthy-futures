In simple terms, the price of food is disproportionate to the nutritional benefits of food. Many analysts explain why & how below:

As countries develop, their food systems get better at providing healthier foods cheaply, but they also get better at providing unhealthier foods cheaply. Hence the problem in less developed countries is that poor people also live in poor food systems: nutrient-dense foods like eggs, milk, fruits and vegetables can be very expensive in these countries, making it much harder to diversify away from nutrient-sparse staple foods like rice, corn and bread. The problem in more developed countries is rather different: unhealthy calories have simply become a very affordable option.************

Some key points from this study by World Bank, 2019 - The high price of healthy food … and the low price of unhealthy food 

- **Sugar makes food cheaper** – Foods high in sugar, like soft drinks and processed snacks, tend to be cheaper because sugar is a preservative. It extends shelf life, reduces waste, and makes mass production more efficient. Since sugary foods last longer, stores can stock up without worrying about spoilage, keeping costs low.

- **Perishability makes food more expensive** – Fresh foods like fruits, vegetables, dairy, and meat spoil quickly, requiring refrigeration, faster transportation, and careful handling. This increases costs for farmers, suppliers, and stores, making these foods more expensive for consumers.
