According to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/outlook/cmo/food/convenience-food/worldwide), the consumption of convenience food will continue to grow in the coming years.

Exploring the information in the note [[What exactly is convenience food]] and referring to the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/convenience-food), convenience food is defined as "food that is almost ready to eat when it is bought and can be prepared quickly and easily."

Using this definition and the insights from our note [[What exactly is convenience food]] as a starting point, I believe we can divide convenience food into two or three categories: 

- **Traditional convenience food**: These are the first foods that come to mind when we think about convenience food, such as frozen pizza, frozen hamburgers, and instant noodles. These ultra-processed foods are often packed with sugar, salt, artificial flavors, and various additives.
    
- **Healthy convenience food**: This category includes items such as canned soup, hummus, protein pots, washed salads, prepared vegetables, and frozen turkey burgers, just to name a few. [Here](https://dhwblog.dukehealth.org/healthy-convenience-foods-that-require-no-cooking-or-prep-time/) is a list of healthy convenience foods, according to Duke Health & Well-Being.

- **Next Generation of Convenience Food**: In my opinion, this category of convenience food has great potential for our research. I see it as "healthy convenience food 2.0." It includes frozen burgers from [Beyond Meat](https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-GB/) or [Impossible Foods](https://impossiblefoods.com), eggs from [Eat Just](https://www.ju.st), and prepped meals from [yFood](https://yfood.com/en-eu) or [Huel](https://huel.com/). What I find fascinating about this category is the variety of food it offersâ€”drinkable meals, supplements, frozen foods (e.g., burgers, meatballs), and even eggs that aren't really eggs! ðŸ˜Š
