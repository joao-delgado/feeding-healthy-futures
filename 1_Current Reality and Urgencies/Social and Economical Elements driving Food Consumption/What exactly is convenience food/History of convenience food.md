[[What exactly is convenience food]]

The ways we worked has affected how we eat, this is a brief run down of world events that 'shaped' convenience food 

**1. Industrialization & Factory Work (19th-early 20th century)**

- The shift from Agrarian societies to industrial economies meant that people had less time to prepare food from scratch.
- Factory schedules were rigid, unlike farm work, which followed natural rhythms. This created demand for quicker meals that could be eaten before or after long shifts.
- Urban living reduced access to fresh, homegrown produce, increasing reliance on preserved, canned, and processed foods.

### **2. World Wars & Military Rations (Early-Mid 20th century)**

- Governments invested heavily in food preservation and portability for soldiers (e.g., canned meats, dried milk, instant coffee). 
- After the wars, these innovations filtered into civilian life, with companies marketing ration-inspired foods for home use (see below for an e.gs)
# Some examples of WAR FOODS:

These are some examples of food that have been create to complete nutrition in combat or emergency situations. These are durable, self-contained, and often include heating elements to warm the food without a stove.

- MREs have also been used for humanitarian aid during disasters.

## Some examples of war food that are eaten regularly now

## Tamales 

Tamales -  a kind of 'dumpling' of sorts where generally  corn, rice, meat and vegetables are wrapped in either banana, corn leaves and then steamed or cooked in water. 

They are eaten across South America in different forms and slightly varying names.

In the aftermath of the Korean War, necessity created an enduringly popular fusion of Korean vegetables and spices with shelf-stable American processed food, _budae jjigae_, or "[Army](http://www.military.com/army) Base Stew." It's a dish that started its life as a means of survival, but continues to be sold across South Korea

# 3. Women Entering the Workforce (Mid-20th Century)**
- As more women took jobs outside the home (especially post-WWII), traditional cooking routines were disrupted.
- Advertisers and food companies responded by promoting time-saving products like frozen meals, instant mixes, and pre-packaged foods.
- The 1950s-60s saw the boom of TV dinners, microwavable meals, and processed snacks, designed for busy families.
# 4. Fast Food & The Rise of Service Economies (Late 20th Century)**

- As economies shifted towards office work and service industries, the demand for on-the-go food grew.
- The expansion of fast-food chains (McDonald's, KFC, etc.) reflected and reinforced busier lifestyles.
- Microwaves, supermarkets, and globalized food systems made convenience food more accessible and affordable.
#  5. Digital Age & Gig Work (21st Century)

- The gig economy, remote work, and flexible work schedules have changed how people eat.
- Meal kits, food delivery apps, and ultra-processed snacks cater to people who don’t have fixed meal times or prefer hyper-convenience.
