# Who is convenience food for 
(extracted from academic paper below)

 - it started off in the 70s being offered as the possibility for newly minted working women to be able to 'have hot, good food at the dining table' for the family
 - Later it evolved to be the option for anyone who is time strapped because of work  
- Working parents with children 
- Solo people, or anyone who is eating alone are likely 
- Older, working men are apparently more likely to eat convenience food than young working women (specific to the EU)
- There is a correlation between the 'knowledge and ability to cook' and getting ready-to-eat meals 
# Academic discussion on this topic:
There is some academic discussion around convenience food, here are some interesting correlations to think about from it.

1. The apparent 'contradictions' between convenience and care - there is a sense of shame/apology around it because its not as good as the 'original' 
2. The socio-economic factors that _enable_ convenience culture from working parents to people working long hours to many groups of people who choose it as it makes their life easier
3. The success and future of convenience food is in its potential to be part of our work-life patterns, and also to find a balance in nutrition - right now there seems to be a heightened amount of sodium/fat but not eating it doesn't automatically assume that consumers are eating healthier either
