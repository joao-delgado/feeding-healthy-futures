# EUROPE

In Europe, these 'convenience stores' have popped up in the last 30-40 years across all neighbourhoods. They are now seen by some as equivalent to supermarkets. Prior to this phenomena, there were restaurants/bars/bodegas opened at early hours or late hours to feed the working class population. 

[[Diaspora & migration|Diaspora & migration]]There is also an interesting correlation between what migrants have built in European cities that bring this 'convenience culture with them' for an e.g in Prague, there is are potraviny set up my immigrant Vietnamese diaspora (I co-produced a documentary on (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY0Y6FzsRHU),  then in Berlin, there are Spätis set up my turkish immigrants [reference] (https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20211021-spatis-the-convenience-stores-that-rule-berlin  and in Barcelona, there are called 'pakis' that sell anything you might need quickly from food and drinks. 

These stores are known for their long working hours, low cost, which essentially ties into what convenience stands for. During the [[Pandemic]] these were the stores that were open and had multiple purposes. 

There is also a growth of Asian stores in Europe selling specialised treats or dishes in Europe due to the rise in [[Ethnic Cuisines]] that are also prepackaged as convenience foods, think kimchi, cup noodles, instant spice mixes like gochujang, fermented black bean pastes, etc. 
# ASIA
In Asia, there are many stores that sell 'ready to eat' in stores like KMart, 711, Family Mart that are affordable, delicious and can be made warm with the in-store microwaves and hot water dispenser. These are also places you can sometimes withdraw money, pay bills, post mail or top up your metro cards.  These stores make convenient food a part of the social fabric as they are part of the regular streets, train stations. There was a spurt of convenience stores in the late 1970s, post war, because there was a big focus on working long hours and the need for quick foods. Typically, food in Asia, especially in Confucian inspired cultures (Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Singapore) or Buddhist influenced cultures, which were supposed to be modest and  

Cup noodles is a big part of Asian convenience food.  Well illustrated by Kontinentalist in this article: https://kontinentalist.com/stories/we-are-just-that-into-mie-asia-s-obsession-with-instant-noodles

Also, there is an interesting added layer of convenience food in the form of snacks that can be found in Asia through specific taste profiles like masala flavoured chips, wasabi flavoured chocolate, for an e.g that have caused an explosion in convenience food, in the form of snacks.

## Japan
Onigiris (rice balls made from sticky rice, stuffed with usually seafood and/or meat) are popular convenience foods that have been around for millennia (apparently it has been eaten during the [Heian period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_period "Heian period") these were established enough to be mentioned in [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_literature "Heian literature").

## Korea
Through popular culture and soft power of shows on Netflix, Korean convenience food culture has skyrocketed around the world, like [[New Generation Food-Fluencers]] show themselves eating copious amounts of convenience foods that have trended recently, for an e.g through Mukbang which is linked to the idea of Hedonism
# US

Supermarkets in the US like costco are famous for their large portions and low prices. This is also where convenience foods are sold in the form of ready made food/microwavable food.
