**Consumption Patterns Influenced by Traditions and Rituals** 
Tradition sand Rituals can influence the way a large group of individuals can eat in a given moment in time, especially when we talk about holidays and celebrations. This has a large effect on the food habits of consumers, their spending budget and the supply chain. Some of the most wide reaching being New Years, Chinese New Years, Christmas, Hanukkah, Diwali, Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr. The ritualistic nature of these events means that there are specific foods that are purchased and consumed in order to celebrate in a traditional way. Not always accounting for the potential effects to the supply chain.  They can increase demand for items that might not always be sustainable or even seasonal. Contributing to a system that perpetuates demand over necessity.
