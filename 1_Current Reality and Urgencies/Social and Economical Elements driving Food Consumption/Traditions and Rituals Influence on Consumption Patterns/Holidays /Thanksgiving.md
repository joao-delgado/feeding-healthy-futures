[8 million turkeys will be thrown in the trash this Thanksgiving](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/388106/thanksgiving-turkey-food-waste-sides-dry-bland)
"On Thursday,  tens of millions of Americans will partake in a national ritual many of us say we don’t especially enjoy or find meaning in. We will collectively eat more than [40 million turkeys](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/22/23970874/thanksgiving-turkey-farming-jennie-o-hormel-white-house-pardon) — [factory farmed](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics) and heavily engineered animals that bear scant resemblance to the wild birds that have been [apocryphally written into](https://www.npr.org/sections/krulwich/2010/11/22/131516586/who-brought-the-turkey-the-truth-about-the-first-thanksgiving) the Thanksgiving story.

"Humans crave ritual, belonging, and a sense of being part of a larger story — aspirations that reach their apotheosis at the Thanksgiving table. We don’t want to be social deviants who boycott the central symbol of one of our most cherished national holidays, reminding everyone of the [animal torture](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/22/23970874/thanksgiving-turkey-farming-jennie-o-hormel-white-house-pardon) and environmental degradation that went into making it."

Some things to extract from this 
- Increase in Consumption Turkey 
- Increase in industrial farming of Turkeys 
- Increase in food waste 
- The tradition of something plays a bigger part than the intention, the holiday meant to bring a sense of gratitude.
