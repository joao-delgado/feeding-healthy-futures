[[Traditions and Rituals Influence on Consumption Patterns ]]

Traditional Foods of the Holiday 
![[Chinese New Year  1.webp]]

**Implications of a tradition**
	Usually with these traditional holidays, there is overconsumption. Based on the idea of abundance, coming from a time and mentality where access to food could be challenging (this is still the case for some). These traditions and rituals often develop out of a form of appreciation to compensate for hard times. 




Dumplings (饺子, jiǎozi) are shaped like ancient Chinese gold or silver ingots, symbolising wealth and prosperity for the coming year. The act of making and eating dumplings during this festival is a familial activity, embodying the hopes for a prosperous and fortunate year ahead. It's also believed that the more dumplings one eats during the Lunar New Year celebrations, the more money and good luck one will have in the new year. **So eating dumplings in abundance is something that I encourage my friends to do.**
