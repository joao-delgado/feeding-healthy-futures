Significance of [Dumplings ](https://www.cntraveler.com/story/lunar-new-year-dumplings-tradition) Anecdote of the origin of dumpling here:

The legend of the dumpling in China seems to be of a medical practitioner Zhang Zhongjing who lived during the Eastern Han Dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD). One cold winter, in an effort to help his family and friends who were suffering from frostbite, he endeavoured to keep them warm. He took some mutton, healing herbs and chilli, wrapped them in dough and steamed them to hold it all together and keep the meat warm. He apparently shaped them like an ear. Not sure why – creative licence? But cute nonetheless!

(Side note and linked to [[Food adoption patterns]] the way in which 'dumplings' as a concept exist all across the world: - Russia (pergogis), Italy (, Nepal (momos), Japan (Gyoza), India (kozhakattis or mothagams), Turkey (manti!), Iran, Uzbekistan etc, etc. 
They all vary in size, shape, fillings, cooking methods (fried, steamed, boiled, baked). They can be sweet or savoury, eaten on their own, or with sauces. They are similar at the most basic – meat or vegetable fillings wrapped in pastry.
