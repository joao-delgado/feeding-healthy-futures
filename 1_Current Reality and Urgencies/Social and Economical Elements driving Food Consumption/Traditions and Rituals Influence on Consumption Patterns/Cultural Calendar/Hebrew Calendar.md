The Hebrew calendar is lunisolar, meaning it aligns months with lunar cycles and years with solar cycles. This system dictates the timing of Jewish festivals, which hold deep religious significance.

- **Rosh Hashanah**: The Jewish New Year, observed in the fall, involves prayer services, the sounding of the shofar (a ram's horn), and festive meals featuring symbolic foods like apples dipped in honey to signify a sweet year.
    
- **Yom Kippur**: Occurring ten days after Rosh Hashanah, this "Day of Atonement" is the holiest day in Judaism, dedicated to fasting, prayer, and repentance.
