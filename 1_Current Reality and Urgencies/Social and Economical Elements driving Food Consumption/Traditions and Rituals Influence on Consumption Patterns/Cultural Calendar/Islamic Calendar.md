The Islamic calendar, or Hijri calendar, is a lunar system consisting of 12 months in a year of 354 or 355 days. Islamic festivals are determined by this calendar, and their dates vary annually in the Gregorian system.

- **Eid al-Fitr**: Celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, Eid al-Fitr is marked by communal prayers, feasting, and giving of alms. **(This is also the ritual / tradition of fasting from dawn to dusk and then breaking fast with a date, milk and usually a feast of food)**
    
- **Eid al-Adha**: Known as the "Festival of Sacrifice," this observance commemorates the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son in obedience to God. It involves special prayers and the ritual sacrifice of animals **(native to the lands - sheep/cow in SEA and Camels in the middle east), with portions distributed to the needy.**
