# Food Intolerance 

[Mayo Clinic ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/expert-answers/food-allergy/faq-20058538)
Causes of food intolerance include:
- **Absence of an enzyme needed to fully digest a food.** Lactose intolerance is a common example.
- **Irritable bowel syndrome.** This chronic condition can cause cramping, constipation and diarrhea.
- **Sensitivity to food additives.** For example, sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods and wine can trigger asthma attacks in people who are sensitive to food additives.
