# Food Allergies 

[Mayo Clinic ](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-allergy/expert-answers/food-allergy/faq-20058538#:~:text=A%20true%20food%20allergy%20affects,and%20causes%20less%20serious%20symptoms.)

> **A true food allergy affects the immune system. Even small amounts of the offending food can trigger a range of symptoms, which can be severe or life-threatening**. In contrast, a food intolerance often affects only the digestive system and causes less serious symptoms.

Allergens on the Rise
BBC, [Why food allergies are on the rise](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201023-food-allergies-why-nut-dairy-and-food-allergy-are-rising)
> A food allergy can be a terrifying thing. When someone eats even a small amount of food to which they are allergic, a minor reaction can involve itching, swelling, and stomach ache. But one in four people unlucky enough to have a food allergy, even a mild one, [will at some point experience a severe reaction](https://www.ted.com/talks/dr_kari_nadeau_let_s_focus_on_food_allergy_prevention/transcript?language=en): anaphylaxis, a state of shock defined as a reaction involving two of the body's organs, is characterized by symptoms like wheezing, dizziness and vomiting. The pulse can slow, blood pressure can drop, and the airways can close. In an alarming number of people in the last few years, it has been fatal.

There are two types of allergic reactions to food.

- **Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated**: This is the [most common](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/food-allergy/#causes-of-a-food-allergy) type of allergic reaction. It happens when IgE antibodies release chemicals like histamine to fight off the perceived invader. Histamine causes typical [allergy symptoms](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/the-most-common-allergy-symptoms-explained-an-interactive-guide#1) and may lead to anaphylaxis, which could be life threatening.
- **Non-IgE mediated**: In this type of reaction, other parts of the immune system respond against the perceived threat. A non-IgE-mediated allergic reaction often involves [skin or digestive symptoms](https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/nutritional/food-allergy/#causes-of-a-food-allergy), such as heartburn and eczema.

Non-IgE allergies may be [difficult to diagnose](https://www.indianpediatrics.net/aug2020/723.pdf) because symptoms can suggest a [food intolerance](https://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/food-allergy-sensitivity-difference) and there’s no blood test for it.

## Insights

Dr. Kari Nadeau: [Lets Focus on Food Allergy Prevention ](https://www.ted.com/talks/dr_kari_nadeau_let_s_focus_on_food_allergy_prevention/transcript)
> Food allergies are rising. In this family that's multi-generational, there's a chance that one in four people will have a food allergy at some point in their lives. That's a 300% increase compared to 20 years ago. In fact, in the United States, two children out of every classroom have food allergies. It's not just a childhood disease though; it's also an adult disease. It's thought that 4% of all adults in the United States have food allergies.
> In fact, it's probably due in a large part to our changes in our modern life. Compared to years ago, we don't live as much on the farms. We don't get exposed to animals.We don't have a diverse diet for our infants as much anymore. And we don't spend as much time outdoors.
