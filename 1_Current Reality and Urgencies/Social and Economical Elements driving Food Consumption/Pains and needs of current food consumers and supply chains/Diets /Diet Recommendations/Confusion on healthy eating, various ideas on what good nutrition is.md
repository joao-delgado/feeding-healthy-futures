General thought, it is hard to decipher. 

From the American perspective, the idea of what healthy eating has changed multiple times. The USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) has created nutrition guidelines since 1894, [this a link ](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/travel-back-time-these-old-usda-dietary-guidelines-180957741/)to a timeline summary. Even as a food professional, having extensive experience within nutrition and gastronomy, while I can infer a lot when I shop or consume food, even still, I question a lot. For and average individual trying to navigate the various recommended [[Evolving Diets|Evolving Diets]], fed diets, evolving labels, ingredient lists, nutrition labels, fortified foods, new studies, influence of globalization on food options, etc. it is hard to know what healthy eating is.

## Insights
An interesting finding in the difference between the current USDA[ MY Plate ](https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/what-is-myplate)vs. the above Harvard Eating plate is that one Harvard has the outlining element as water and the my Plate has dairy. Something that is very pervasive in the USA, is the lobbying and political power the dairy industry has. By looking at this, I can imagine that the USDA has an obligation or pressure to include dairy within their dietary guidelines. The underlying motives of any funded research can by biased based ***political motives**. 
Which is something that can lead to consumer misinformation within the greater health system. 

So what is healthy eating? 
While guidelines can be a start, and there are helpful guidelines, healthy eating goes beyond this. It requires a lot more nuance that includes culture context, location, dietary restrictions, access, taste preference, daily physical output (ex. manual vs sedentary work), lifestyle and being a more conscious consumer, driven by understanding your own unique needs rather than convenience or powerful suggestion.
