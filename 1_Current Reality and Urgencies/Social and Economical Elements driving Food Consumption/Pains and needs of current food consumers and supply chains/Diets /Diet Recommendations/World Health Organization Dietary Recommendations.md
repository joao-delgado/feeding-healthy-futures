>As suggested in [Healthy Diet WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet), a healthy diet varies based on individual and cultural factors, but its core principles remain unchanged. It would be valuable for the research to explore these topics further, as they are crucial for addressing our first key research point: socio-economic factors driving food consumption patterns (map).

[Healthy Diet WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/healthy-diet)

Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains.

The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet remain the same.

Helpful General Guidelines 
- Reduced Sodium Intake
- Reduced Sugar Intake (especially added sugar not from wholefoods)
- Daily Exercise
- Reduced Fat Intake, especially trans and saturated 
- Fruit, vegetables, legumes (e.g. lentils and beans), nuts and whole grains (e.g. unprocessed maize, millet, oats, wheat and brown rice).
- Avoiding processed/packaged foods
