# Mediterranean Diet 


> [!NOTE] Title
> Taahira: its fascinating and related to [[Feeding Healthy Futures/1_Current Reality and Urgencies/Food adoption patterns from history/Global movement/Gastro-tourism]] that the Mediterranean Diet is seen as an UNESCO Intangible Heritage?  I think this makes us really wonder how [[Traditions and Rituals Influence on Consumption Patterns|Traditions and Rituals-]] affect tourism and also our adoption of healthy food habits?




- **Wikipedia**, [Mediterranean Diet ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet#:~:text=The%20Mediterranean%20diet%20is%20a,formulated%20in%20the%20early%201960s.)
	- The **Mediterranean diet** is a concept first invented in 1975 by the American biologist [Ancel Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancel_Keys "Ancel Keys") and chemist Margaret Keys. The diet took inspiration from the eating habits and [traditional food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_food "Traditional food") typical of Crete, much of the rest of Greece, and southern Italy, and formulated in the early 1960s.


**==- NY Times==**, [The Mediterranean Diet Really Is That Good for You. Here’s Why.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/well/eat/mediterranean-diet-health.html) 
	- 'The diet prioritizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, herbs, spices and olive oil. Fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like salmon, sardines and tuna, are the preferred animal protein source. Other lean animal proteins, like chicken or turkey, are eaten to a lesser extent. And foods high in saturated fats, like red meat and butter, are eaten rarely. Eggs and dairy products like yogurt and cheese can also be part of the Mediterranean diet, but in moderation. Moderate alcohol consumption, like a glass of wine at dinner, is also allowed.'
