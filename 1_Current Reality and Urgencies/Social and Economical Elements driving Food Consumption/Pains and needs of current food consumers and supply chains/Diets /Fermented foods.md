> Fermentation is definitely a topic we should explore in our research. Besides the brief history—which is always interesting for providing historical context—it would be valuable to examine why certain products, such as sourdough bread, tempeh, miso, and kombucha, which have existed for ages, are becoming so popular today.

**WHEN** 
Evidence of a fermented alcoholic beverage made from fruit, honey, and rice found in Neolithic China dates back to 7000-6600 BCE. Wine-making dates to around 6000 BCE in Georgia, in the Caucasus region of Eurasia. There is also strong evidence that people were fermenting beverages in Babylon around 3000 BCE. 


Even before fermented alcoholic beverages were developed, humans were fermenting a type of food with notoriously poor holding qualities – dairy. Particularly, the milk of camels, goats, sheep, and cattle was naturally fermented as far back as 10,000 BCE. It’s likely that the fermentation occurred spontaneously, rather than intentionally, due to naturally existing microflora present in the milk. 

**HOW**

The subtropical climate where this dairy fermentation took place likely played a large role in its occurrence, as thermophilic lactic acid fermentation favors the heat of this climate. It has been suggested that the first yogurts were produced in goat bags draped over the backs of camels in the heat of North Africa, where temperatures around 110°F during the day made ideal conditions for fermentation to occur.

**The Inventor/Connector**

It wasn’t until the mid 1800s, though, that people understood what was happening to make their food ferment. In 1856, a French chemist by the name of Louis Pasteur connected yeast to the process of fermentation, making him the first zymologist – or someone who studies the applied science of fermentation. Pasteur originally defined fermentation as, “respiration without air,” and he understood by his observations that fermentation never occurred in the absence of simultaneous cellular propagation and organization. At this time, fermentation was still being used solely to increase the holding and storing properties of food.
