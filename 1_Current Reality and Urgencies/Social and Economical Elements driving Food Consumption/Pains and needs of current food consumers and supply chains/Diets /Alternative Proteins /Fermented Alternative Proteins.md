# Fermented Alt Protein

## What is Fermented Alt Protein 
[World Economic Forum ](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/11/fermentation-can-help-build-a-more-efficient-and-sustainable-food-system-here-s-how/)
> Within fermentation, there are three primary production methods of alternative proteins:
> 
> ****Microbial fermentation**** has been used for many years to produce ingredients such as enzymes where microorganisms transform one type of food to another **(think beer or yogurt)** and in the biopharma industry to produce vaccines and drugs. The same technology is now being applied to produce a new generation of proteins, fats and other functional ingredients that enable the creation of animal-free meat, eggs and dairy. 
> 
> Many may recognize **whole-biomass fermentation** from [Quorn’s](https://www.quorn.us/) meat-free mycoprotein nuggets, patties and fillets. There are also innovative startups working to produce whole-muscle products using whole-biomass fermentation such as [Atlast Food Co.](https://www.atlastfood.co/) and [Meati](https://meati.com/).
> 
> The third method, **precision fermentation**, uses customized microbes to produce vast quantities of specific proteins normally found in animal products but without having to breed, feed and slaughter an animal. The most well-known example is rennet, a protein found in nearly all cheese. Rennet traditionally comes from the stomachs of slaughtered calves, but now can be produced by a special strain of yeast. [Perfect Day Foods](https://www.perfectdayfoods.com/) is making whey and casein proteins using precision fermentation and recently launched spinoff brand Brave Robot to sell [animal-free dairy-based ice cream](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/brave-robot-ice-cream-launches-as-the-first-brand-from-the-perfect-day-backed-urgent-company/). [Clara Foods](https://www.clarafoods.com/) is also creating egg proteins with this technology.

> “It's a texture thing...” No, really. Lucky for us all, mycelium is very similar to muscle tissue, making it easy for our culinary team to gently form our main ingredient into any shape, texture and flavor. Like a perfectly blank canvas, we marinate our mycelium with a handful of natural ingredients (spices, herbs, all that) to create the delicious protein and fiber-rich cut you know and love.

**### Precision Fermentation**
[Perfect Day ](https://perfectday.com/proferm/) Non-Dairy Whey 
> Perfect Day uses the decades-old process of precision fermentation to create ProFerm™, a highly functional whey protein that contains no lactose, cholesterol, hormones, or pesticides.
> ProFerm is a highly functional and innovative dairy ingredient that makes dairy products like milk, yogurt, cream cheese, and ice cream more sustainable and just as craveable, creamy, whippable, spreadable, and delicious.

[Clara Foods](https://every.com/), The Every Company Non-Animal Protein Eggs 
> We use two ingredients found in nearly every kitchen: yeast and sugar. We take the DNA sequence of chicken egg protein and insert it into yeast. We feed the yeast sugar, which in turn, is naturally converted into protein through fermentation.
> Looking ahead, EVERY is poised to continue transforming our food system, accelerating adoption of hyper-functional proteins that can't be isolated from nature–from avian species to those far beyond.


## Sustainability 
Biomass Fermentation [Quorn ](https://www.quorn.co.uk/mycoprotein)
> We then use the age-old process of fermentation – the same process used to create bread, beer and yoghurt – to grow Quorn mycoprotein. And because producing Quorn mycoprotein takes 95% less CO², than typical beef mince[1], it is a great example of a more sustainable and nutritious protein source for a growing global population.

Precision Fermentation [Perfect Day ](https://perfectday.com/blog/life-cycle-assessment-of-perfect-day-protein/)
> This study found that, compared to the total protein in milk, Perfect Day whey protein is: 
> - **91% to 97% lower in GHG emissions** 
> - **29% to 60% lower energy demand**
> - **96% to 99% lower blue water consumption**
