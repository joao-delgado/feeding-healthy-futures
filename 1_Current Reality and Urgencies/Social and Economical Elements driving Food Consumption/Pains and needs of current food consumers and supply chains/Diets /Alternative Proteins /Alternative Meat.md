Alternative proteins—**meat made from plants, cultivated from animal cells, or produced via fermentation**—are designed to taste the same as or better than conventional animal products while costing the same or less. 

Compared to conventionally produced proteins, alternative proteins require fewer inputs, such as land and water, and generate far fewer negative externalities, such as greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and other public health risks. 

Numerous plant-based and fermentation-derived options are available to consumers today. Other products, such as cultivated meats, remain primarily in development.
