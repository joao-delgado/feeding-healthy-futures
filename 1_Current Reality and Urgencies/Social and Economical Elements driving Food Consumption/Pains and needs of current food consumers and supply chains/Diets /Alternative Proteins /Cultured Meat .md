# Lab-Grown Meat  (Cultured Meat)


> [!note] > Diogo's comment
> Another very important note for our research! 😊 Based on what we have been studying, cultured meat will be a key topic throughout our work. In my opinion, this is not only a topic relevant to the "Present" but also to the "Future".
> 
> Another interesting aspect of this note is its correlation with [[Influencers in Food]], specifically José Andrés and Francis Mallmann. Based on this note, the influencers' note, and this room on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/#room=59ee18489e58a715a050,7KxvX8-X0-jIb_kCQbildA) (especially the part stating that "only 9% of influencer posts meet quality standards"), I believe we should explore the topic of influencers further.


## What is Lab-Grown Meat  

What exactly is lab-grown meat? Here’s what you need to know. [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/lab-grown-cultured-meat-alternatives)
> The first step to creating cultured meat is to procure animal cells, often via biopsy from an animal—either living or recently slaughtered—or by extracting cells from a fertilized egg. These cells are placed in [culture media](https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-cultivated-meat/deep-dive-cultivated-meat-cell-culture-media/) [](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/premium/article/lab-grown-cultured-meat-alternatives#_msocom_3)to encourage them to multiply; but if you’re imagining a bunch of scientists hunched over petri dishes, think bigger.![[Screenshot 2025-02-11 at 9.39.42 AM.png]]

> The nascent cultivated meat sector is being overseen by both the USDA and the FDA.
Good Meat, [which has been selling its products in Singapore](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/02/business/lab-grown-chicken-intl-scli-scn/index.html), advertises its product as “meat without slaughter,” a more humane approach to eating meat. Supporters hope that cultured meat will [help fight climate change](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/21/world/cows-methane-asparagopsis-c2e-scn-spc-intl/index.html) by reducing the need for traditional animal agriculture, which emits greenhouse gases.

> This Spring, two states in the [US have banned the sale of cultivated meat.](https://www.fooddive.com/news/cultivated-meat-becomes-part-culture-wars-us/716223/) Alabama and Florida banned products made from animal cells, playing into claims the product is a threat to livestock farming.

## Up-Side | Down-side

### Up-side
> Kaplan, for example, points out that because cultured meat can theoretically be grown anywhere, countries would no longer have to import as much food.
> Plus, “because the technology allows much more control of the inputs and outputs, you could, for example, have fat cells with a healthier fatty acid composition, and you can reduce the use of antibiotics and other chemicals in food,” he says.

### Down-Side 
> Marco Springmann, an environmental scientist at the University of Oxford [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/lab-grown-meat-could-exacerbate-climate-change-scientists-say.html) that the amount of energy required for the production process is so great that cultured meat has [five times the carbon footprint](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/19/lab-grown-meat-could-exacerbate-climate-change-scientists-say.html) of chicken. The biggest practical challenge right now, he says, is how to produce enough product to stock restaurant kitchens and grocery aisles.

## Sustainability 
Here’s what we know about lab-grown meat and climate change, [MIT Technology Review ](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/03/1075809/lab-grown-meat-climate-change/)
> Where the total emissions from cultivated meat production will fall in this range depends largely on where the energy comes from to run the bioreactors: if it comes from the electrical grid, which will still rely partly on fossil fuels, the carbon impact will be much higher than it will be if renewables are used to power the facility. It also depends on what ingredients are in the media used to grow the cells.

## Insights
There is still hesitation for consumers around the consumption of lab-grown meat, it is a very contentious food item. The scale at which it can be produced still leaves it at an expensive price and the energy use still leaves question to wether it is a sustainable option.   The use of highly influential chefs have been deployed to gain acceptance from the foodie community.
