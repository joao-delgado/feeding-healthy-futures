# Plant based Protein

[[Plant-Based Proteins  ]]

## What are Plant-Based Proteins?
[Good Food Institute ](https://gfi.org/plant-based/)
> Plant-based meat is produced directly from plants. Instead of relying on an animal to convert plants into meat. Alternatives to meat like tofu and tempeh have been around for thousands of years. The plant-based meat industry in the United States dates back to the 19th century.
> The plant-based meat market has expanded significantly in the past several years, as companies produce plant-based burgers and other products that are virtually indistinguishable from conventional meat. 

## Types of Plant-Based Proteins

### **Tempeh, Tofu, Seitan, Textured Soy Protein**
Tofu, made from soybeans; Tempeh is a fermented soy product, Seitan, made from wheat gluten, and TVP is made from defatted soy flour, which is a byproduct of soybean oil production

Alternative Plant-Based Proteins have a long tradition in Asia.

> One of the reasons plant-based meat alternatives were widely consumed in China was due to [Buddhism](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/china-fake-meat-vegetarian-intl-hnk/index.html). Buddhism prohibits the killing of any person or animal, leading Buddhists to adopt vegetarian diets. As part of their tradition, Buddhists incorporated “[First-generation](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/23/13271)” plant-based meat alternatives – tofu, tempeh, and seitan – into their vegetarian diet.

**Veggie Burgers, Sausages, Tofurkey** 

### **Biomimicry Proteins
A Novel Meat for the New Age, [The Chemical Engineer ](https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/features/novel-meat-for-a-new-age/)
> Using a biomimicry approach, companies aim to match the organoleptic properties of meat, such as flavour, aroma, texture, and appearance, using plant protein sources.

 [Beyond Meat ](https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-GB/products/beyond-beef)and [Impossible Burger](https://impossiblefoods.com/nutrition/plant-based-impossible-ingredients) 
The most noticeable difference between the two faux meat brands is **the use of “heme.” Impossible uses it.** **Beyond does not, relying instead on beet juice to give it that meaty color.**


## Insights

[Good Food Institute ](https://gfi.org/plant-based/)
>  Plant-based meat category remained small and relatively stagnant until recently, with the ****market largely limited to vegans and vegetarians.****
>  This “biomimicry” approach began in 2012 with the launch of Beyond Meat’s chicken strips, and it really took off with the 2016 launch of the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger, both of which have succeeded in mainstream fast-food outlets.



## Examples

# Western influence / introduction to plant based proteins 

The 19th century marked a significant turning point in the scientific understanding of plant proteins. In 1838, Dutch chemist Gerardus Johannes Mulder conducted elemental analysis of common proteins and proposed they might be composed of a single type of molecule[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein). The term "protein" itself was suggested by Mulder's associate Jöns Jacob Berzelius, derived from the Greek word πρώτειος (proteios), meaning "primary" or "standing in front"[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein). Though Mulder's conclusion about protein structure was eventually proven incorrect, his work initiated deeper scientific inquiry into protein composition.

Thomas Burr Osborne compiled a comprehensive review of vegetable proteins at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, furthering scientific understanding of plant-based nutrition[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein). Working alongside Lafayette Mendel, Osborne established several nutritionally essential amino acids through feeding experiments with laboratory rats, demonstrating that diets lacking essential amino acids stunted growth[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein). This research was crucial in establishing the nutritional value of different protein sources, including those derived from plants.

A pivotal moment in the commercial development of plant-based proteins came in 1877 when the Kellogg brothers invented "Protose," a meat substitute made from peanuts, wheat gluten, and various other plant-based ingredients[4](https://leverfoundation.org/beyond-the-trend-the-history-of-plant-based-meat/). While not comparable to contemporary plant-based products in taste or texture, Protose represented an early commercialized attempt to create plant-based alternatives to meat and laid the groundwork for future development in this field[4](https://leverfoundation.org/beyond-the-trend-the-history-of-plant-based-meat/). The Kellogg brothers' innovation reflected both health-conscious and religious motivations, as they were associated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which promotes vegetarian diets.
