# Funding 

**European Funding** 

[Vegconomist,](https://vegconomist.com/science/european-alt-protein-research-public-philanthropic-funding-2023/) NOV 12, 2024
> A [report](https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/State-of-the-European-alternative-protein-research-ecosystem_-funding-2020-April-2024.pdf) by GFI Europe has found that European alternative protein research received more public and philanthropic funding than ever before in 2023, **increasing from €63 million in 2020 to €290 million in 2023**. This figure is likely to be matched or surpassed by the end of 2024.
> 
> Since 2020, the European Commission has granted €252 million to alt protein research, mainly through the [Horizon Europe](https://vegconomist.com/science/eu-horizon-europe-cultivated-fermented-protein-research/) program. Of this, half was invested in 2023 and early 2024.
> 
> By country, Denmark has funded the most research at €96 million since 2020. The UK is close behind at €90 million, partly due to the establishment of a network of [research hubs](https://vegconomist.com/cultivated-cell-cultured-biotechnology/uk-government-12m-fermentation-hub-alternative-proteins/) by the funding body UK Research and Innovation

> Investments in alternative proteins pass $16 billion
> - The alternative protein industry raised $1.6 billion in investments in 2023 and another $899 million in the first three quarters of 2024, bringing all-time investments to over $16 billion.
> - 80 percent, or $13.8 billion, of this total, has been raised since the start of 2020 when the coronavirus first disrupted global markets.
