## Current needs of consumers 

> [!note] > Diogo's comment
> I think we should delve into the topic of transparency. I'm not just referring to transparency in the supply chain but to transparency in our food in general:
> - Where does our food come from?
> - How is it treated/grown?
> - Why is nutritional information so unclear?
> - What do bio signs mean?
> 
> I suspect that answering these types of questions will help us stay on track and gather the necessary information for our key research points in the first part of the project:
> - Socio-economic factors driving food consumption patterns (map)
> - Mapping the pains and needs of current food consumers
> - Historical food adoption patterns
