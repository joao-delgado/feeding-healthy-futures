# Consumption Behaviors of Consumers

> [!note] > Diogo's comment
> As the article [Meaning of Food and Consumer Eating Behaviors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329321002263) suggests, there is limited understanding of how the different meanings people attribute to food influence their consumption behavior.
> 
> This could be related to my note on [[Feeding Healthy Futures/1_Current Reality and Urgencies/Social and Economical Elements driving Food Consumption/Pains and needs of current food consumers and supply chains/Consumers /Climate Change Concerns|Climate Change Concerns]]—what transparency means to consumers. We can apply this approach to other topics:
> 
> - What does sustainability mean to consumers? Is it eating an organically farmed product produced 10,000 miles away, or a non-organically farmed product produced within a 100 km radius?
> 
> - What does a healthy meal mean? Does the meaning of health differ across cultures, e.g., the USA vs. China?
> 
> In my opinion, understanding the true needs and beliefs of consumers will be crucial in properly recognizing both existing and emerging food consumption behaviors.

> Prior research suggests that food is embedded in a system of meanings. Yet, little is known about how the different meanings people attribute to food affect their food consumption behavior. Results of a nationally representative survey in Austria reveal how food meanings (sacred, moral, health, social, and aesthetic, assessed with the Meaning of Food in Life Questionnaire) relate to a wide range of food consumption patterns (health-conscious, discerning, indulgent, and functional). 
> 
> - First, **health-conscious eating behaviors** (e.g., following a healthy diet, frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables, buying seasonal and regional foods, cooking, following medical recommendations about nutrition were driven by the **social and moral meanings of food**. 
> - Second, **discerning eating behaviors** (e.g., buying organic products, shopping at small stores or local markets, avoiding meat products, prioritizing quality over quantity) were predicted by the **moral meaning of food**. 
> - Third, **indulgent eating behaviors** (e.g., consuming salty and sweet snacks and ready-made meals, eating on the go, overeating) were driven by the aesthetic meaning of food and a **lowered importance of the health** meaning of food. 
> - Finally, **functional eating behaviors** (e.g., consuming functional foods such as dietary supplements, enriched foods or “light” products, paying attention to food labels, buying groceries with a shopping list, buying groceries online) were driven by the **sacred meaning of food** and a **lowered appreciation of the aesthetic** meaning of food. 
> 
> Taken together, these findings suggest that food meaning can serve as a useful framework to understand [[Evolutionary Psychology of Food|different patterns of food consumption]], generate novel insights and provide actionable recommendations.
