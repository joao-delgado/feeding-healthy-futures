As highlighted by some examples in the article, cheese can sometimes have a greater greenhouse gas impact than a lamb chop, and wild shrimp and lobster can have a greater impact than chicken or pork. This misinformation might be related to the lack of transparency typically associated with how food is produced and its supply chains.

Paper on Reducing climate change impacts from the global food system through diet shifts By [Yanxian Li](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-02084-1#auth-Yanxian-Li-Aff1) et. al on what and how we eat, where it is produced can create huge differences in GHG emissions. 

On the basis of detailed household-expenditure data, the paper evaluates the unequal distribution of dietary emissions from **140 food products in 139 countries** or areas and further model changes in emissions of global diet shifts. 
Within countries, consumer groups with higher expenditures generally cause more dietary emissions due to higher red meat and dairy intake. Such inequality is more pronounced in low-income countries. 
The present global annual dietary emissions would fall by 17% with the worldwide adoption of the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet, primarily attributed to shifts from red meat to legumes and nuts as principal protein sources. More than half (56.9%) of the global population, which is presently overconsuming, would save 32.4% of global emissions through diet shifts, offsetting the 15.4% increase in global emissions from presently underconsuming populations moving towards healthier diets.**

very adorable illustration from NYT and Q&A style for how climate change affects our food consumption. This is dependent on where you are eating / where you are from and this is a US perspective:

Lack of transparency when it comes to their supply chain


- consumers are unclear of bio signs/what goes into their food
- nutrional information is unclear
- use of pesticides/hormones/etc in our food 

In this paper, specific challenges of food supply chains are highlighted. Major elements are addressed that support transparency to consumers, the government and food companies, which are considered the claimants of transparency. Elements considered to be enablers of transparency are governance mechanisms, quality and safety standards and information exchange. The paper specifies these transparency claimants and enablers for food supply chains and identifies major information system functions and information technology applications needed to comply with transparency demands. It thereby provides a framework for transparency analysis in food supply chains.
