## Patagonia Provisions 

Based on my work with Good Food Foundation, I can tell you that Patagonia Provisions is the curator of a product. They work and vet other companies that procure an ingredient or make a product to then make a Patagonia Provision product or partnership product (Ex: Deschutes Brewery x Patagonia Provisions) 

[Sourcing for Crackers ](https://www.patagoniaprovisions.com/pages/seeds-sourcing-1)
Examples of full transparency of cultural significance and recognition of the product

> Quinoa has been a culturally significant crop in Andean society for millennia, and it is cherished as a reliable source of food security. The name quinoa even translates as “mother grain” in some Andean languages. Quinoa is so important, it was historically offered as a sacrifice in religious ceremonies.
[[Export-Oriented Agriculture]]

> Chia originated in Mexico but has been grown in South America for centuries, where it’s long been prized as an energy-rich food source.
> The cultivation of these crops continues to strengthen local communities today. SIMPLi partners with Indigenous communities by investing in their future, sharing expertise on farming methods, soil health and market access. They also pay farmers above market rates for their crops, helping to improve quality of life and forming a sustainable economic future, while preserving cultural heritage.

Certification of Regenerative Practices
