> Nearly 9 out of 10 Europeans believe that “strengthening the farmer’s role in the food chain” is important. The concept of SFSCs involves minimizing the intermediary steps between producer and consumer, creating not only more transparency in the food system but also a deeper level of trust.

In addition, SFSCs include consumers purchasing retail food produced locally, or consumers purchasing food grown elsewhere that is accompanied by information about its place of origin and production process.
