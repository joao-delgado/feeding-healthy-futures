# Innovative Transparency with Design Thinking

Using a design thinking lens and food professionals' understanding of the confusion consumers face with selection because of the complexity of selecting healthy food, varied professions can work together to develop and create a clear form of communication. [[Confusion on healthy eating, various ideas on what good nutrition is]]

[LEX ICONS](https://lexiconoffood.com/lex-icons/) 
To develop this open source language system, the team collaborated with Adobe and hundreds of artists from the international design community, as well as experts in the areas of equity, food waste, climate change, agroecology, fisheries, agrobiodiversity, regenerative agriculture, alternate proteins, food safety, and true cost accounting. Together, they aligned on core terms and definitions for a foundational visual language to describe our food systems.

These Icons can be used in various ways to interpret food systems. All of which use a more universal language, images rather than language.
