# Technology Used for Food Transparency 

## Farm to Table Tracking for the Consumer 
[TITAN ](https://titanproject.eu/)is a Horizon Europe project dedicated to developing transparency solutions for transforming the food system. Titan will provide an extensive platform for the development of a wide range of innovations that aid transparency and address societal and planetary health to make the food system fair, healthy, and environmentally friendly.

TITAN will develop 15 innovative solutions including exploiting **DNA-based Rapid Detection Methods, Blockchain, AI, and IoT to**

- enhance transparency in agri-food businesses with a focus on SMEs,
- improve food choices by providing more transparent information to the consumer,
- enhance food safety and authenticity of products and
- provide improved information on the health and sustainability of food products.

TITAN is partnered with QualityChain
### [QualityChain](https://qualitychain.ch/en/about.html)
>  QualityChain helps SMEs in the agri-food sector to transform their products from simple objects on a shelf to powerful digital experiences that showcase their uniqueness. QualityChain is a transparent space in which to share with consumers the history and values of small Italian and European producers, a window that lets you see the skilled hands working the land, making wine, bread, and every other treasure our companies produce.

## Distributor Tracking

> The labels have high-tech sensors that can track motion, temperature and tampering for automated proof of delivery, and are useful for a host of industries including agriculture. Food companies can use the data to address shipping challenges and better understand what is happening to their products across the value chain.

Allowing for the possibility to identify problems in the distribution channel allows for the ability to reduce waste and establish better protocols for transportation which would not only be a more efficient use of resources but also create a better quality product to the consumer.
