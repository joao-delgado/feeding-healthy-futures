Nutrition and food literacy are two important concepts that are often used interchangeably, but they are not synonymous. Nutrition refers to the study of how food affects the body, while food literacy refers to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to make informed decisions about food and its impact on health. 

According to Scopus and Web of Science, nutrition literacy appeared first in the title of a scientific document in 1995 in a study carried out by Sullivan and Gottschall-Pass that was carried out to assess the food label nutrition knowledge of healthy Canadians, i.e., to evaluate their nutrition literacy. 

Nutrition literacy continued to be used without a specific definition; it was used under the umbrella of the more general term health literacy. Don Nutbeam [8] identified three health literacy levels: functional, communicative/interactive, and critical. 

Having nutrition literacy may not be sufficient to achieve the desired well-being and health. It is necessary to have food literacy; that is, to have knowledge, skills, and behaviors that are interrelated and that are necessary to decide, handle, choose, cook, and eat food [13–15]. Food literacy is an individual’s ability to make decisions that lead to better individual health status and lead to a sustainable food system considering all social, environmental, cultural, economic, and political factors
