Across the world, there are different ways in which food and information about food is taught to kids. This note looks at the general overview of how and in what ways food is taught in formal education (early primary school levels)

(it seems to me that from my primary research that there is no deeper understanding of nutrition of  the impact of food on community, environment, etc. It seems to be more focused on macros & micros? reference: https://medium.com/illumination/why-food-education-should-be-on-the-menu-in-u-s-schools-d148d1c389a4)
# UK

UK is similar, however, there seems to be an organisation called Nesta, an innovation agency for social change that is promoting a 100million GBP policy change? 

This policy would increase the provision of information to children relating to nutrition, diet-related health and food preparation in primary school settings. This can be classroom-based, but may also be part of a wider whole-school approach through, for example, a school garden project or field trips to nearby farms. This could be standalone interventions (nutrition only) or multi-component interventions, which include nutrition education.

# Asia

In Asia, approaches to nutrition education differ widely. For instance, Japan emphasizes healthy eating habits from a young age, with schools employing professional nutritionists and serving meals prepared from scratch. This focus contributes to low childhood obesity rates and high life expectancy. In contrast, other Asian countries may have varying levels of nutrition education, often influenced by local dietary practices and economic factors.

In fact, in Japan, they have a special word for it: **Shokuiku** ([Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji "Kanji"): 食育) is the [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language") term for "[food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food "Food") [education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education "Education")". The law defines it as the "acquisition of knowledge about food and [nutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition "Nutrition"), as well as the ability to make appropriate decisions through practical experience with food, with the aim of developing people's ability to live on a [healthy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health "Health") [diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_\(nutrition\) "Diet (nutrition)")".

There is also the use of a catchy phrase, Ma-go-wa-ya-sa-shi-ii (まごわやさしい)
To encourage a more plant and seafood-based meal, the phrase **ma-go-wa-ya-sa-shi-ii** (まごわやさしい) has been in circulation for some time.

It’s an acronym for **ma**me/beans (豆), **go**ma/sesame (胡麻), **wa**kame/seaweed (わかめ), **ya**sai/vegetables (野菜), **sa**kana/fish (魚), **shi**itake/mushrooms (しいたけ), and **i**mo/potatoes (芋). This phrase also spells out “the grandchild is kind” phonetically.

# Europe

Across Europe, food education policies vary by country. A study analyzing primary school curricula in 11 countries found that each had dedicated food education components, often focusing on cooking and health topics. However, there was no standardized approach, and topics like social-cultural aspects, equity, and sustainability were less emphasized. This indicates a need for a more comprehensive and unified approach to food literacy in European education system. 

Generally, there were different terms used across countries:

|**Food Education Term**|**Definition**|
|---|---|
|**Home Economics**|“at school, the study of cooking, sewing, and subjects relating to the management of a home” [18] “a curriculum … to discover and further develop their own resources and capabilities to be used in their personal life, by directing their professional life, preparing them for life” [19]|
|**Food Technology**|“knowledge and skills to design and make food products effectively … use the physical, chemical and nutritional properties of foods to meet a specific need … implement their design hygienically, safely and effectively. They need to evaluate the design and the product” [20]|
|**Nutrition Education**|“any combination of educational strategies accompanied by environmental supports, designed to facilitate voluntary adoption of food choices, and other food and nutrition-related behaviours conducive to health and wellbeing (of individuals, community, planet)” [21]|
|**Food and Cooking Skills**|“a wide range of skills required to feed families, including not only factors involved with the meal preparation … but also knowledge of how to plan and budget for food and organise and plan meals that other members of the household will find acceptable” [22]|
|**Food Education**|“Education that supports learning about food, nutrition and the role that food plays in one’s life, relationships, culture, communities, environment, and in history and society” [23]|
|**Food Literacy**|“the ability of an individual to understand food in a way that they develop a positive relationship with it, including food skills and practices across the lifespan in order to navigate, engage, and participate within a complex food system. It’s the ability to make decisions to support the achievement of personal health and a sustainable FS considering environmental, social, economic, cultural, and political components” [24]|
