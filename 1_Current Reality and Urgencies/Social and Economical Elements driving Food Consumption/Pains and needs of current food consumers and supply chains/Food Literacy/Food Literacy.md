Food Literacy broadly holds the idea of being 'aware' of what we eat. 
Research shows that food literacy consists of several components, including food knowledge, food skills, and resilience in food preparation and planning. A recent cross-sectional study found significant relationships between these components of food literacy and healthy eating habits, with only 26.4% of participants demonstrating high levels of food knowledge despite its importance[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19485565.2024.2397346).Â Importantly, the study revealed that increased health promotion literacy positively correlated with improved healthy eating habits, suggesting that broader health awareness contributes to better nutritional choices[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19485565.2024.2397346).
