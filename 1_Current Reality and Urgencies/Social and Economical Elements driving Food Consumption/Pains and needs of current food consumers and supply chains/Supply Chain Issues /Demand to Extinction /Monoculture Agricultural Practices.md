# Demand increases Monoculture 

By growing monoculture plants, **farmers usually benefit from higher profits**. For example, cultivating a single kind of crop that is best suited to development in specific climate conditions, allows the farmer to get better yields and, therefore, get higher income 

Major Monoculture crops include wheat, wheat, corn, rice, rapeseed, sugar cane, and cotton.

## Insights
Dan Saladino, [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/mar/22/1000-varieties-banana-lack-of-diversity-extinction) 
"The lack of diversity could mean the fruit’s extinction. It offers a stark warning of what could happen to other key foodsThe demand for low-cost, high-yielding varieties has resulted in vast monocultures of just one type of globally traded banana, and this is true of many other crops as well. Homogeneity in the food system is a risky strategy, because it reduces our ability to adapt in a rapidly changing world."
