# Understanding Food Labels

## Misinformation 

Many people still don't understand the expiration dates on foods because there are so many different labels that don't have any standardized format. Sell-By" Date, Best If Used By/Before" Date, Use-By" Date, Expiration Date, Quality Assurance Date.

**The lie of “expired” food**, [VOX](https://www.vox.com/22559293/food-waste-expiration-label-best-before) USA
>They’re not standardized, and they have almost nothing to do with food safety.
Date labels first started appearing in the decades following World War II, as American consumers increasingly moved away from shopping at small grocery stores and farms and toward supermarkets, with their rows of packaged and curated options.
Since the 1970s, Congress has periodically introduced legislation to modernize and standardize the system, in various forms. But, as Broad Leib told me, it can be an uphill battle. “The last administration and Congress were fairly deregulatory,” she pointed out. In the years since the 2013 study, many states have passed laws to try to standardize their own dates, even if they don’t align with other states.

**Use-by and Best Before**, [Intelligest ](https://intellidigest.com/campaigns-plan-to-save-week-3-understanding-food-labelling/) USA 
> 'The date or label marking on food packaging is one of the factors that significantly influences consumers' decision to keep or discard food. There’s a common misconception that the “best before” date and the “use-by” date on food products mean the same thing; **confusion over date labelling accounts for an estimated 20 percent of consumer food waste**. Understanding the difference between these two terms will help you reduce food waste: **sometimes food is still safe to eat after the “best before” date, whereas the “use-by” date informs you when it’s no longer safe to eat.**

## Date marking and food waste prevention, [European Commission ](https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety/food-waste/eu-actions-against-food-waste/date-marking-and-food-waste-prevention_en)
> 'The following date labels are used: use by/expiry dates, best if used by/best before dates, and sell by dates. Understanding their meaning will help consumers develop a better purchasing habit and reduce household food waste.'
> Better understanding and use of date marking on food, i.e. **"use by"** and **"best before"** dates, by all actors concerned, can **prevent and reduce food waste** in the EU.
> A study carried out by the European Commission (2018), estimates that ****up to 10% of food waste generated annually in the EU is linked to date marking**.**

## Creative Design 
[Columbia Retailer](https://www.contagious.com/news-and-views/campaign-of-the-week-wholesaler-in-colombia-extends-life-of-fruit-and-veg-with-stickers) using sticker to create a visual aid to help reduce food waste
> To combat this attitude, Dutch-owned cash-and-carry wholesaler **Makro** and **Grey Colombia**, Bogotá, created stickers featuring recipe suggestions tailored to the degree of ripeness of fruits and vegetables. The **Life Extending Stickers** look just like usual branded stickers, except they mimic the colour of each food item at various points of its ripeness journey. For example, a banana’s sticker goes from green to yellow to brown and finally black, with a serving or cooking suggestion over each colour – in the banana’s case the copy reads (in order of ripeness) fried, ice cream, tempura, cupcake.
