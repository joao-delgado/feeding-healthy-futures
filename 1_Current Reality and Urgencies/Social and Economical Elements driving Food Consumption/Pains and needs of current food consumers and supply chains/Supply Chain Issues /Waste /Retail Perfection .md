# Retailer Food Waste 

Harvard Business Review, [How Large Food Retailers Can Help Solve the Food Waste Crisis](https://hbr.org/2017/12/how-large-food-retailers-can-help-solve-the-food-waste-crisis)
> Some traditional food retail practices can unintentionally increase food waste. **Over the years, supermarkets have embraced high cosmetic standards for fruit and vegetables, leading them to reject even marginally imperfect-looking food** (e.g., too short, long, big, small or uneven in shape, too red or not red enough, and so on). To curb this food waste, grocery chains such as [Asda](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/05/asda-puts-uks-first-supermarket-wonky-veg-box-on-sale) (Wal-Mart) and [Morrisons](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/18/morrisons-waste-initiative-wonky-vegetables) are experimenting with selling “wonky” vegetables at discount prices.

## Insights

Everything Under the Sun  [Ugly but Perfect: America’s Wasteful Obsession with Perfect Produce](https://medium.com/@daniel.s.kang/ugly-but-perfect-americas-wasteful-obsession-with-perfect-produce-6344479557af)
> The truth is that America is obsessed with perfection. Perfect hair. Perfect body figure. Perfect apples. However, the worship of the prototype form had led to a wasteful problem. Globally, we throw out about 1.3 billion tons of food a year, or a third of all the food that we grow. That’s absurd. Imagine walking out of your local grocer dropping 1 of your 3 bags maybe containing eggs, onions or bananas and leaving it there and driving off.

Forbes, [Food Waste Is Becoming Top Priority For Grocers - And They Are Trying To Get Shoppers Involved Too](https://www.forbes.com/sites/claraludmir/2023/08/30/food-waste-is-becoming-top-priority-for-grocersand-they-are-trying-to-get-shoppers-involved-too/)

> The global volume of food waste is estimated at [1.6 billion](https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/196402/icode/ "https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/196402/icode/") tonnes, 80% of which is considered edible; this represents more than 30% of all food produced, and [6%](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector "https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector") of global greenhouse gas emissions. **While a part of this waste can be attributed to the** **production and harvesting phase of food and to consumer behavior, a considerable part of it is due to supply chain weaknesses on the manufacturer and retailer front.** This is thankfully becoming a source of investigation and optimization, especially given that food waste or loss costs them around 3-6% of their COGS according to McKinsey [research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/reducing-food-loss-what-grocery-retailers-and-manufacturers-can-do "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/reducing-food-loss-what-grocery-retailers-and-manufacturers-can-do"). As reducing food waste becomes a business imperative, retailers are increasingly looking for ways to optimize their supply chain, but are also increasingly trying to appeal to shoppers to help them on their mission.

## Examples

Companies Working to Change this 

VOX, [A scientist on the myth of ugly produce and food waste](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/26/18240399/food-waste-ugly-produce-myths-farms)

> In the past few years, several startups have stepped in ostensibly to try to break the cycle of ugly food waste. **Venture capital-backed companies like [Imperfect Produce](https://www.imperfectproduce.com/), [Full Harvest](https://fullharvest.com/), [Hungry Harvest](https://www.hungryharvest.net/), and [Misfits Market](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/1/18/18188248/food-waste-ugly-produce-misfits-market) say they provide a solution to the problem:** They create a new channel of distribution for farmers, offer customers ugly produce at a significant discount to what the groceries would cost at retail, then donate the rest to food banks.
> 
> They say that a lot of the ugly produce goes to waste. But there’s a huge part of that produce that goes to food service, where it gets cut up and appearance doesn’t matter.Honestly, **I think these companies just found a good hustle that makes them look good and makes money.** There’s nothing morally wrong with that, but to go out and say, “I’m saving the world and I’m fixing a food problem,” when there are actually better solutions is really disingenuous. It’s just a profit-oriented solution.

My partner Jerry has worked in the produce industry for a long time. There are different grades of produce. So there is the possibility of a secondary market of lesser quality items to be used in places that also process food. For example a juice company does not care much for the look of the produce since it will be turned into a liquid form and will buy it at a reduced price.
