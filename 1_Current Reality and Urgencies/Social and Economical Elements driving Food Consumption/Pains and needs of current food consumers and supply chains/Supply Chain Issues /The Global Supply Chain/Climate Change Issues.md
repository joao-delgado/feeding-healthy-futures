# Climate Change Issues

## Greenhouse Gas Emissions 

Food and Climate Change: Healthy diets for a healthier planet, [United Nations ](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/food)

[About a third](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00225-9/) of all human-caused **greenhouse gas emissions** is linked to food.  
 
The **largest chunk** of food-related greenhouse gases comes from **[agriculture and land use](https://www.fao.org/3/cb3808en/cb3808en.pdf)**. This includes, for instance:
- methane from cattle’s digestive process,
- nitrous oxide from fertilizers used for crop production,
- carbon dioxide from cutting down forests for the expansion of farmland,
- other agricultural emissions from manure management, rice cultivation, burning of crop residues, and the use of fuel on farms.  
- 
A much **smaller share** of the greenhouse gas emissions of food are caused by:
- **refrigeration and transport of food**,
- **industrial processes** such as the production of paper and aluminum for packaging,
- the management of **food waste**.

## Crop and Tradition Migration

### [Terroir That Travels: Making Maps](https://genomicgastronomy.com/uncategorized/terroir-that-travels-making-maps/) January 21, 2025

For _Terroir That Travels_, Genomic Gastronomy set out to visualize how foods protected under the [E.U.’s Geographical Indication (GI) scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_indications_and_traditional_specialities_in_the_European_Union) might migrate due to climate change. These foods are linked to specific regions, local traditions, and unique terroirs, so the threat of climate change means a lot is at stake for these rural communities—both in terms of economy and heritage.

2024- 2080 Focusing on 
- Carne Marinhoa(PDO), migration of garlic from lower France to Northern Germany
- Ail rose de Lautrec (PGI), migration of cattle from Maderia to Central Portugal 
- Westlandse(PGI), migration of grapes from the Netherlands to lower Sweden
