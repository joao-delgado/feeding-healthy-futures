'Emma Mcdonell wrote about the Quinoa boom. It became so popular, it was exported all over the world. Quinoa became something everybody wanted as it should because of the nutritional value. This got the campesinos, the people in the highlands that were growing it started to feed their children rice instead of quinoa because they were selling the quinoa for a higher price. And of course some of the children became malnourished because they just didn't have the same thing that they used to.'

[The Quinoa Bust Book by Emma Mcdonell ](https://www.ucpress.edu/flier/books/the-quinoa-bust/paper)
Quinoa rose to global stardom pitched as an unparalleled sustainable development opportunity that heralded a bright future for rural communities devastated by decades of rural-urban migration, civil war, and state neglect. The Quinoa Bust is based in a longitudinal ethnography centered around Puno, Peru, the main quinoa production area in the world’s chief quinoa exporting country. This book traces the social, ecological, technological, and political work that went into transforming a humble Andean grain into a development miracle crop and also highlights that project’s unintended consequences. The Quinoa Bust shows how even efforts based in the best of intentions—counteracting the homogenization of [[Crop Origins]], empowering small-scale farmers, revaluing local food cultures, and adapting agricultural systems to climate change—can generate new kinds of[[Colonisations & Trade| oppression]]. At a time when so-called forgotten foods are increasingly positioned as sustainable development tools, The Quinoa Bust offers a cautionary tale of fleeting benefits and ambivalent results.
